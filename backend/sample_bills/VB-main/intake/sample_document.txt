I was pulled over by Officer Martinez of the State Highway Patrol on Interstate 95 near mile marker 127 on January 15th, 2024 at approximately 3:30 PM. He claimed I was speeding 78 mph in a 65 mph zone and issued citation #SP-2024-00789. 

The officer demanded to see my driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. When I asked about his authority to make this stop, he became agitated and threatened to arrest me for obstruction. He said I must appear in Municipal Court on February 20th, 2024 or face additional penalties including license suspension.

The citation contains several errors: it lists my vehicle as a 2018 Honda when I drive a 2019 Toyota, and the location is incorrectly stated as mile marker 125 instead of 127. The officer also failed to provide me with a copy of his calibration certificate for the radar device used.

I was traveling for personal business, not commercial purposes, and believe this stop violated my constitutional right to travel. The fine amount is $275 plus court costs, with a deadline to pay or contest by February 5th, 2024. 

Notwithstanding my objections to the stop, I am subject to the court's jurisdiction according to the citation, which creates a contradiction in my legal standing. I need to understand my options for challenging this citation and protecting my rights.
