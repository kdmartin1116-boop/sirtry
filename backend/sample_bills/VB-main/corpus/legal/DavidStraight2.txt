everybody's at different stages in this learning game of the great awakening because we're all waking up across the
country This is a biblical thing Nobody made it up at least not on this earth
anyway But uh we know exactly what's going to go on approximate time frames
of what's going to happen And right now we're in
a an exciting time to be alive
the this is a war between good and evil It's also a war between we the people
and the bar association The bar association is a
cause of the vast majority of problems we have in America and the world They
own and control everything I got a a good friend He's fairly
young His name is Justin And Justin sailed through high school He has the
ability to read and retain every word every page every page number look it up
later know where it is what book it came out of who wrote it Just blows my mind
His level of competency two years of law school and he got a jur
doctorate after high school Probably one of the youngest attorneys I've ever seen Passed the bar on his first try with an
800 score Nobody does that And he went to
work for one of the largest law firms in Seattle And at his celebration party
they rented the Space Needle for a celebration party for the night And so
the entire law firm had it They had dinner and then Justin's standing there and he's looking out the windows at the
city lights of Seattle and the main partner of the law firm walked up and
put his arm around Justin and he said "What do you see out
there do who who do you think controls all of
that we've got some of the largest companies in the world We've got Microsoft and Amazon and Boeing right
here in Seattle Who do you think controls those who do you think controls the little mom and pop stores down there
on the pier and downtown who do you think controls the state of Washington's
government and all the little municipalities and the and the county governments who do you think controls
all that and Justin proceeded to say 'Well we the people elect our representatives and
they control government and the CEOs make the decisions for the corporations
And the leading law partner let out a big old belly laugh and he he says
"No not one CEO not one legislator makes a
decision Not one invoice not one piece of sales literature not one
contract is written by any of them They're written by us
They don't make a decision without running it past their legal
department We the bar association makes the decisions that run the
world And Justin looked him in the eye shook his hand and said "I
quit." And now he's helping the people with the law He tore his bar cart up and
he walked out and he threw it away Okay I'm really proud of
him Over the years I've probably got 20 or 30 attorneys to tear up their bar
cards and I've got judges that help us because they understand once I've
taught them the basics that they didn't know what the law was They didn't know its origin They
didn't know what it came from If I was to ask you where did the law come from what's its origin how did we arrive at
this thing called law where a small group of men could put something down on paper and try and hold me a man
accountable could you answer that question
you watched my video Okay No actually it wasn't It was Genesis 1:26-28
God gave me man dominion over the land the air and the water And this is
law The land became common law common all mankind It's property its equity its
rights It's our rights They're unalenable What does unalenable mean
they cannot place a lean upon our rights That's what it means Those rights
are unalenable It has to do with things of
property nature patents and grants and
securities gold and silver commodities things we own right things we own That's
what common law is It deals with properties and it deals with our rights
The air which is the highest form of law The air is above the land which is above the
water The air is ecclesiastical or canon law which is trust law All things held
in trust held in the benefit of another are errors It's trust law That's all it is
in Genesis 1:26 through Genesis 2:25 is a trust
indenture Why did God start that off right in the very beginning of the Bible
he put the world under trust to mankind We're the
trustees He's the executive He placed it to us to manage for the
benefit of our beneficiaries our future heirs for generations to come Lives on
in perpetuity forever And what is the definition of forever until the end of the
earth forever is till the end of the earth Then we're in
eternity Okay so it lives on in perpetuity forever
The jurisdiction of the water is admiraly law It is commerce It's
contract law Things held in contract with
another Now there's some interesting elements to a true contract that the bar
association doesn't want to teach you the bar association teach you there's got to be an agreement consideration
and both people have to sign and you've got a contract Well that's
not true There's eight elements of a contract Okay But one of the most important of those elements is a
contract has to be between like kind Can a man write a contract with a man yes
And when I use the word man today that means mankind Not being gender specific
It's mankind It's our species Okay So a man can have a
contract with a man but a corporation has to have a contract with a
corporation Can a man have a contract with a corporation
no Can't It's like kind versus like kind Why did they put things in
corporations anybody know why did they start doing that
so that people are in the corporation not only the assets You're you're
exactly right It's to limit liability
So if a man has integrity
purpose knows all eight elements of a contract and writes a proper contract where there's a meeting of the minds
There's full and honest disclosure of the terms and conditions of the contract There's equal consideration where one
person gives something up and one receives and the other gives something up and the other receives Has to be a
two-way street If that's true why do they have to form
corporations no I'm I'm serious The reason is is because lack of
integrity If we had integrity we'd never need a corporation If we were honest
we'd never need a corporation Corporations exist so that people can
take be taken advantage of Yeah
because they have no integrity So that's a that's a pretty sad thing
Um and one of the main things we got to learn
is the United States of America is not the same thing as the United
States It's not the same thing as USA Inc
Salt Lake County is not the same thing as the county of Salt
Lake Salt Lake City is not the same thing as Salt Lake City
incorporated Okay you are not the same thing as your
all caps name So my name David Lester Strait spelled
in all capital letters is not the same as David Lester straight in upper and
lower case What happened is a vessel was
created a vessel and the law clearly talks about vessels over and over and
over again Why am I talking so much about
law it's because kindergarten through 12th grade how many law classes did you have why
that's right The moment you turned 15 years old and got a permit to operate a motor vehicle that
you didn't even need you've been dealing with the
law and yet you never had any classes They teach you algebra How much algebra
have you used since you got out of high school not much No most people haven't
Okay So they teach us things we don't necessarily need and leave out the things that we do I thought it was a
government funded government controlled curriculum government school
system At some point in time somebody's got to take responsibility for our education Who's
that going to be i don't think it should be should be our
parents You know it really should Our parents are responsible That's one of the reasons I
feel so lucky I had great parents and they taught me to question
authority Now that my school that I went to told me not to question authority So
in my early days my parents went in one ear and out the other and the school sunk in and I
obeyed authority in the early days
Okay And that always gets you into trouble
So what city are we in riverton So if the city of Riverton police drove in
right now who are they do you know
statute code enforcements Well that's right It says policy on the side of their car Police is policy They're
policy enforcement agents Doesn't say law enforcement It's policy Supreme Court of the United
States says rules codes statutes and ordinances are
not law They're not law They're corporate bylaws
They're for employees of the corporation to fall off So are you an employee of the
corporation of the city of Riverton unfortunately
not for this discussion Okay You're
not but you are because you consented And what I mean by that is you
volunteered and you call yourself you selfdetermined Your very first
foundational cornerstone unalenable right is your right of self-determination The church teaches it
as free agency Right that's the right to self-determine What's right what's wrong
so you self-determine that you're a citizen a person and a
resident And if you are you need CPR because you're dead You're a dead entity
You ever heard the term all are equal in the law rich or poor black or white
y'all have equal standing things like that it's because you're all dead
What is an indictment an indictment is a true bill Says that right at the bottom of every
indictment It's a bill It's an invoice Did you bother to ask how much is the bill if you were
indicted no Nobody does So you're brought up on charges You don't pay the
charges you're asked to bond If you don't pay the bond your body is held assured you for the bond Well
they collect from your sust Do you understand those are all
banking terms So what is a court look up the word court in a legal dictionary It says
C bank C post office You look up the word judge it says C banker C
postmaster Everything is banking Do you know you have a 72-hour ride of recision
on everything you get a ticket from a police officer and he gives you a ticket for speeding down the road you can
resend that ticket within 72
hours So I didn't ask do we have any police officers in the room any
attorneys any government agents that's a shame I wish you guys had some of those around because I'd love to debate them
for just a little bit Take I take a red Sharpie in a 45 degree
angle I write your offer to contract is not accepted while traveling in private my private
automobile You operate under title 18 section 241 and 242 as a conspiracy to
deprive me of my rights under the color law and I mail it back in
even if it's feeding no matter what Here's some case law Operation of a
motor vehicle upon public streets and highways is not a mere privilege but is a right or liberty protected by the
guarantees of federal and state constitutions The use of the highways for the purpose of travel and
transportation is not a mere privilege but a common and fundamental right of which the public and the individual
cannot be rightfully deprived No state government entity has the power to allow or deny passage upon the highways
Transporting his vehicles and personal property for either recreation or business Travel is not a privilege that
can be permitted at will with forced insuranceances registration or licensing but a common and fundamental right of
liberty granted by the constitution Okay Where can we find that
the use of the automobile that I got pages and pages of pages I carry a folder in my pickup like this
that is about that thick and no cop can argue with it It's
got Supreme Court decisions It's got case law It's got everything What is case law by the way already determined
No it's the opine The opinion of a judge is somebody's
opinion Do you understand no matter what side of the fence you're on or what subject you're arguing about you can
find case law that supports your opinion Okay what do attorneys get taught in law
school case law Case law Case law Case law That's it I've proved to attorneys
before that they didn't learn the law in law school See there's three types of law
There's superior law supreme law and corporate
bylaws That's it Supreme
law is laws given to us by God They're
unalenable Okay they're the Ten Commandments and more It's not just 10
guys That's just the most important ones Okay they're
unalenable Supreme law And the whole reason we have state and federal supreme
courts is our constitutions and our treaties Those are supreme
laws The purpose of the Supreme Court is to see if a lower court decision
conforms to the Constitutions and treaties of the United States of America
That's their only job when they the Supreme Court hears a
case And by the way you got a 5% chance of getting a case before the Supreme Court 5% That's it Out of all the ones
that submitted only 5% get heard But their only job is to see if
the decisions of the lower courts conform to our constitutions and treaties Do you know that's we the
people's job it's not up to them We're supposed to nullify them We're supposed to nullify
them through our juries and we're supposed to nullify them every time we
get a letter in the mail that's addressed to our all caps
name When you get a letter in the mail you have a 72-hour right to
resend to correct the errors our public servants make and to educate them so
they don't do it again That's your job That's all of our jobs And you know what
we haven't done the last hundred years we haven't corrected any of their
errors They make these tremendous they call clerical errors and we don't
correct them then we acquance Government operates through the
consent of the governed What does that mean that means they presume
something See if you guys can see this
They presume something They
assume something They get your tacid
agreement that you're a citizen person and a resident so you need
CPR And then they use hearsay
to convict you put you in jail charge you a fine or a fee or a tax or whatever it may
be They say it's to tax the poor which might not otherwise be taxed So they
lead you down a path They railroad you What is the legal definition of the
term railroad to lead someone down a narrow path or rail to a predetermined outcome
or conclusion Predetermined How do I know
it's predetermined i'll tell you my best confirmation of
it About five years ago in the Ninth District federal courthouse in front of
Judge Mosman the lead judge of the ninth district which was known as the most
liberal district of our federal courts
I brought a case and the case I
brought was basically there was a grandmother who was found guilty before
I met her by a jury She was tried and found guilty of four felony counts of
fraud She did nothing wrong nothing But they spent four days in a
trial railroading her and then gave her half a day to defend herself and denied
all of her witnesses denied all of her evidence What's she going to do then
don't you have a right to defend yourself don't you have a right to a face your
accusers they didn't care They said basically told her she had no
rights She couldn't bring the Constitution up in the courtroom They did the same thing to Shauna Cox and
Ryan Bundy the Bundy's They said "Don't bring that Bible into the
courtroom Don't bring that Constitution into the courtroom." Why did they say that
separation of church state No it's because you're not a party to it Did you know that did you know that you guys
aren't a party to the Bible and you're not a party to the Constitution What does that mean ah I'm
about to tell you Give me just a moment So let me finish with Judge Mosman for a
minute What I proved with Judge Mosman is that there's two
governments that there's a dure government of we the people where we the people lay down the
law and a government steps outside of their scope and authority of the law in which we the people lay down Then
they're committing felonies They're committing imoluments violation
Okay that's article one section six clause 8 of the constitution An
emolement violation What is an emolement anybody know it's where we pay them to do
something that we lay down that we tell them what to do and they act outside of
that scope and authority and they collect a fee from us It's not part of their job
description It's not part of the law in which we lay down and they act outside
of that Therefore they commit emolment violations They're stealing from us from
the public that they're getting paid by to do something we didn't tell them to
do or didn't give them authority to do That's what an emolement violation
is I also proved that judges and prosecutors get a net retention or a
commission for finding someone guilty A commission And I also prove
that they share that with the defense attorney
for a guilty verdict Now what is a guilty
verdict what is a guilty verdict what do they do when they arraign
you they want you to plead guilty or not guilty Really did you know those are
both commercial terms guilty and not guilty is both commercial terms Did you know that in on
property on land industrial commercial and residential are all commercial
terms who owns a house no you don't You don't really own You don't own your
house The state owns your house They can do anything they want with it You know why because the county came along with a
bunch of people who were compartmentalized legal idiots and they stole your property on
behalf of the state from you and you didn't correct the errors so therefore
you acquanced was telling you about Ken Cromer his house was foreclosed on by
the court kicked out of his house he lived with somebody else that through
the mercy of someone else he lived Him and his wife lived for 10 months somewhere
else and I got him back into his house How did I do
that i helped him get his land back in land under the original land
patent and accept the grant deed And no government can deny that or kick you out
of your home if you own your property It's called a superior title
superior title How do you get your superior title what's that how do you
get your superior title that's later on in the class
Okay See most people have a warranty deed And a warranty deed is called an
abstract of title I used to own 20% of a title company And I didn't know this when I
owned it Yeah Had a real estate company two
mortgage companies a building supply company three development companies a construction company with 96 employees I
had a specialty building supply company at one time I was doing pretty
well And I didn't know all this So they took it away from me Took everything
away from me Sure Sure Did you know all mortgages in
the United States are fraud every one of them Everyone is fraud Did you know your
mortgage was paid off your mortgage was paid off the moment
you signed the mortgage application and they accepted it
You know who paid it off you did See you're not a debtor You're a
creditor You just don't know it You don't know it They want you to think
you're a debtor and that you're indebted to them Your signature paid off that loan
immediately And you don't know why do you okay I'm going to teach you guys why I'm giving you What I'm doing right here
is I'm It's called a tease I'm teasing you with a lot of little things that we're going to cover later in depth Okay
but I'm trying to wake you up right now Wake you up to things you don't
know But you can go through this whole thing and it's case law Supreme case law
everything of why you don't need a driver's license to drive Okay Now there are three cases
where you do need a driver's license When you're hauling passengers for hire
Are you an Uber driver Lift driver a taxi driver a bus driver
you need a driver's license Are you hauling goods or services for interstate
commerce a truck driver you need a driver's license Are you a public
servant in the performance of your public duties a cop a fireman driving a
fire truck whatever An ambulance driver you need a driver's license But if
you're just getting up in the morning leaving your house going to the store going to work going to a movie coming
home doing whatever it is you do you're in your private business
affairs You don't need a driver's license That's a title What about a
title you don't own your car You don't own a car Have the title No you don't
You have a certificate of title You don't own your car either The state
owns it See here's the thing All right let's tell you a little story
I happen to like Chevy crew cab long bed Duramax diesel trucks because I like
farming and ranching Okay Show us how to own our car right if I walk into a Chevy
dealership it's called an automobile dealership right it's not called a motor
vehicle dealership because it's not a motor vehicle when they sell it to you It only
becomes a motor vehicle when you title license and register it Before that it's an automobile It's
private Who was our first car insurance company in the United States it was called travelers
insurance It was designed for travelers That's what we are We're travelers We
travel from point A to point B And there are private business affairs 99% of the time Okay You walk into an automobile
dealership if I laid out $75,000 cash for a brand new crew cab Duramax diesel
pickup and you might be 80 by now at that moment in time I own that
truck but the minute the salesman looks at me and says "I need another $250 for
title license and registration please." And I give them another
$250 instead of that stack of 75,000 That's the moment I gifted that pickup
to the state So what I do is I look at them and I say "No that's not necessary I'm going
to export it to a foreign country." And then when I get in and I
turn the key and I drive it off of their lot I'm driving it out of the state of
Oregon into Oregon I just exported it into a foreign nation
Yeah Manufacturer statement of origin is in that little envelope that comes with your truck When you pay the
$250 he removes that He fills it out He sends it to the state He sent the state
the title and you get a certificate A certificate means there's a title out there somewhere But you don't have
it You don't have it You don't own these cars How does that work if you get pulled over if you own your car they
can't do anything to you Yeah but you don't have a license plate Wait by the time we're into this three-day thing
you're going to be blown away I'm telling you Okay
See the reason I talk so much about driving and and automobiles is because
that's usually the first place any one of us gets into trouble in our life we
get a ticket or something else but it's usually associated with driving or
operating a motor vehicle by a person a citizen or a resident So what is the legal definition
of the word citizen city is
municipal Zen is servant A municipal servant Isn't that
what our public servants are we're calling oursel the same thing
We're calling our public servants We're We just became We've registered with the Department of Human
Resources with the HR Department of the State of By the way where's the state of Utah located
washington DC 44 Northwest Congress Avenue Washington DC Okay
It's not even in Utah Utah is a foreign nation to the state of
Utah What about the city of Riverton that's a subsidiary of the county of
Salt Lake Salt Lake County which is a subsidiary to the state of
Utah They're all private for-profit entities Bill Clinton revealed that to
everybody He sold off all of government Everything is a private for-profit entity
Everything that wasn't already previously sold off which was most of it to begin with He sold off what was
left A private for-profit entity It has a Dun and Brad Street number Do anybody
know what Dun and Brad Street is it's a credit reporting agency for corporations
right so if they've got a Dun and Brad Street number that means they're a corporation
Right what does the Supreme Court say says "Since governments have chosen to incorporate they must follow the same
rules as any other corporation." Well wait a minute Can a guy wearing a Walmart shirt
little blue shirt come into your house kick your door down and steal your kids what would you do
well wait a minute City of Riverton Police is a private for-profit entity a
corporation with the Dun and Brad Street number They're no different than
Walmart They operate through the consent of the government They have to get your
tacid agreement that you're a citizen or person or resident What is the legal
definition of the word person an entity or a vessel an entity or a vessel What is the
legal definition of the word resident someone there temporarily to do business What's your zip code Jody
by writing that on the letter to your grandmother
By writing your zip code on the letter to your grandmother you just told the United
States Postal Service And what are our courts post offices See I already teased
you with that right they're banks and post offices So by writing this on the letter to your
grandmother you just told the postal service our court
system that you'll inhabit that you live in Washington
DC and that you just reside in Riverton temporarily to do business
So there's 337 million people in the United States who live in Washington DC
and about 40,000 state nationals who live in the rest of the
states But you just guys just move in temporarily to do business all around
us How do you feel about that huh
it's the truth But you write a letter as to put brackets around the zip code Ah
why why do you put brackets around the zip code put it back where it belongs No to remove it from the contract
It's called the boxing rule Brackets would be the equivalent
four corners The four corners rule The boxing rule Brackets have four corners
Five years ago I was made an ambassador for the voice of youth
program Uh voice of youth was a part of the world benefit church The world
benefit church was put in to place for one reason and one reason only not to
have a congregation and preach the gospel but to educate world leaders
on God's laws on what's right and what's wrong It's the only reason they they
were put into place The voice of youth program was put into place to be the voice of people who couldn't speak for
themselves our minors What is the legal definition of
the word minor it's someone under the age of 18 right
we all know that part of it Or this part we don't know Someone of any age who
hasn't claimed their minor estate Have you claimed your minor estate you're a minor Have you have you
did you even know you had a minor estate what if I told you you were worth
millions of dollars and you didn't even know it and what if I could prove it to
you and that you have a trust fund and you're all trust fund babies And that
trust fund is worth hundreds of millions of dollars And so when you sign that
mortgage they borrowed out of your trust fund and paid it off And then you just
keep paying it back and paying it back and paying it back Why is that
five years ago as ambassador of voice of youth I gave a speech at the
Hague and I told our world leaders the story of a mother
and the story of a mother I was told afterwards from just about everybody
that this is the mo most important story that should be told every man woman and
child on earth but that they don't want me to tell it You never tell me not to do
something that's right because then I'm going to tell it over and over and over again Amen
Okay a mother nine months pregnant Pay close attention to this guys Telling you
it's important for your life your children's lives your grandchildren's
lives for generations to come But a mother nine months pregnant
walks into a foundling hospital What is the legal definition of the word
foundling it's a safe place to abandon a child Did you know all
churches all hospitals all police stations and all fire stations in the
United States are designated as foundling by Congress
You can take a baby and put it in a basket and walk into any of those four
locations and set that basket down on the floor and smile and wave and walk
out without any consequences to yourself
whatsoever Can you even imagine that that you can abandon a
child but they designated those places as family hospitals Did they tell you
on a brass plaque somewhere in an obscure location inside the hospital
probably under a stairwell it says this hospital is a founding hospital Found found
lean hospital So a mother nine months pregnant walks into a family hospital
She goes through a major medical procedure called childbirth where she's in pain and under duress
She's probably under the influence of painkillers of some
type You got to be pretty tough to give birth I wouldn't want to do
it
Anyway she has that beautiful baby and all she's thinking about is getting home with it and leaving But see the baby in
history throughout history came out of the water was tugged through the birth canal was docked at the dock by the dock
tender where a bill of ladyading was filled out and received on the cargo where its soul was taken its soul plates
the footprints of the baby The placenta was
taken Okay They took the baby's soul Then they sent it out with a tug and is presumed
dead and lost at sea until it should return and claim its minor
estate No physician delivers a baby Only a doctor does Doctor is dock
tender The baby is a vessel a ship That's where the all caps
name comes in If you look at the names of ships are in all capital letters
okay no one disclosed the terms and conditions of the contract yet You were handed a
stack of papers to fill out and you were only told and this was right out of the nurse's manual this is just to register
your baby with the state and to give it a name and you fill out the
paperwork and you name your baby and you sign as an
informant What is the legal definition of the word informant someone who gives someone else
up to another thereby giving the title and equity of your child to the
state This creates a doctrine called parents patray Guess I should write that
It's Latin for state is your parent state is the
parent creates a doctrine of parents patri through this doctrine that's how
they have control over you and through your consent of being a citizen a person
or resident three things you never want to I hope the chair is not too comfortable
I want I don't want to see you doing that now All right I'll throw something at you Anyway
uh the doctrine of parents
patray So no terms and conditions of the sales contract were given No full and
honest disclosure of the contract No two wedding signatures
No one there was securities licensed insurance licensed no
perspectus was given If you go to your stock broker and you want to invest in a corporation you he is required by law to
give you a perspectus right and you weren't given
one What I'm trying to teach you here is it was all done through fraud without any full honest disclosure of the
contract You were licensed bonded
insured Your vessel was created A susta QB trust was
created A cest trust is an individual trust underneath the umbrella of the
public charitable trust
So the public charitable trust act of 1882 created a public charitable
trust The cestuvie trust act created the cestuvie trust Each individual trust
that you all have through your birth certificate and registration On your birth certificate there's a bank name
It's on bond paper There's a cuspup number cusip number
What is a CUSEP number it's an investment control number that's regulated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission If you were born between 1933 and 1975 you were bonded for
$630,000 and insured for 1 million If you were born after
1975 you were bonded for 1 million and insured for two
Now wait a minute Wait a minute That's just the initial investment It's initial upfront investment You were a few days
old right so like me I was born on April 20th on 420
Nice I knew there would be one in the
crowd And my vessel was created on
53 Two different dates two different events My vessel was born on May the 3rd
I was born on April 20th For that period of time I was a state national In fact I
was a Californian I was born in California and I was a state national I
was a free independent one of we the people for that
long And then I got registered and I became a citizen a
person and resident And I lost all my diplomatic
immunity I lost it all I became a servant a slave
See the 13th amendment the Constitution freed the black slaves In the 14th Amendment the Constitution made all of
us slaves See there's a maximum law that says that in which one creates one
controls God created me and he controlled me And then
unknowingly while under duress without any full and honest disclosure of the terms and conditions of the contract
with no one even license to explain it available My mother
warded you to the state warded me to the state in a birth ward I became a ward of
the state Why do you think a birthing ward is called a ward
i became a ward of the state a war to the court under the doctrine of parents
patray I became a slave and I didn't even know it I grew
up thinking I was free I fought for this country I thought I was free I got shot
I thought I was doing it for the right reasons Thought I was free Now I teach veterans how to get rid of
PTSD and I can do it in 20 minutes I know guys that have been going to psychologists for years and taking drugs
for years trying to get rid of their PTSD and it destroys their wives and their families and themselves and I can
solve it in 20 minutes Yes please How I explain a a little something
that's off track So would you do me a favor get tell remind me to tell you
Okay It's very important All right
What happens what happens at our birth with the Cesta QV first of all we
have a PCT public charitable trust an umbrella There's 337 million little
CQVS CESQV trusts one for each of us right in this country
Say that one more time CQV Yeah Every individual in the
United States and in most countries of the world have assessed a QV trust And
we have this CQB And here's what happens And this is incredibly important You all know basic
accounting What is that it's a balance sheet right a balance sheet It's got
debits and credits You guys have been thinking you're the
debtor They keep telling us that right we're in debt We're a debtor We owe money on credit cards We owe money on
our houses We owe money on everything What happens at birth
though and what I'm just going to use the figures from 75 to now because it's
round numbers We were bonded for $1
million What does that mean that means the bank went to the
International Monetary Fund and the bank on behalf of the public under your cusup
number borrowed from the International Monetary Fund $1
million in ones fives tens 20s 50s hundreds and they threw it out there
into the general public They distributed that $1 million to the bank for every person who's born That's what they do On
the credit side $1 million worth of United States Treasury
bonds are issued and they're sold They're
hypothecated They are bundled and they are sold on the stock
exchange And if we wanted to I could pull up a website if we had internet
access and I could put in one of your CUSP numbers
And I could show you the companies that are buying and selling you today You have more than one cusup number By the
way as we increase in value I'll just put it
that way As we get better in our life the more we join the military or get
more college degrees we get more and more acusup numbers You are the credit
You are the creditor They're making you believe you're also the debtor And you are
You're both This is your vessel This is you Okay this is your labor This is your
worth I got five college
degrees Every time I got an advanced degree in college I got a new CUSIP number Was in the military I got a new
CUIP number All these cusp numbers are attached to my main birth number
Okay this is in a bad spot Anyway let's stop here It's a balance
sheet right it's balanced It's got a million on one side a million on the other This gets invested It keeps
growing and growing and growing And let's just say it grows to a hundred million dollars And by the way that figure is
low I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt Really I've seen individuals worth
35 billion or more that didn't know they had a dime Okay it keeps growing and growing and
growing Our first 18 years of life we're not spending anything So nothing is
going over here Our first 18 years that's growing and growing and growing for 18 years And it's being hypothecated
and traded And they've done a good job of managing it They really have first 18
years it's growing and growing and growing You're not spending anything You're not adding anything to the debit side Then you go get a job and you get
married and you go out and you buy a house I'm just going to use numbers And
the numbers themselves don't matter It's the concept Okay you buy a car or
two You buy some utilities or two over your lifetime some medical bills some
food whatever They keep track of it all through your tax returns your credit card your bank statements Banking is all
tied into the IMF the Federal Reserve We got a big buildings of bean
counters called the Department of Fiscal Services and they those accountants just
keep track of everything everybody's life And this all starts to add up on
the debit side And this just keeps growing and growing and growing On the investment side at some point in time
you die and it goes through probate They take some of this and let's just say
over your lifetime you've spent I'm going to round it off to $10 million So they subtract 10
million out of your investment and they pay off all this and it becomes a zero
balance They even pay back the initial loan to the International Monetary Fund plus interest That was a
loan from a foreign entity by the way to the public charitable trust and
they pay it back The balance is zero Now this has let's just say for
this discussion has $90 million left in it What happens to it
the Cesta QB trust lives on in perpetuity forever So it keeps going
Everyone who has ever died since 1933 is currently funding government
This money gets reinvested They can't take this but the
balance must stay the same forever But if it keeps earning they
just sweep it off the top and it funds government It's called
offbook funds G in the states it's GSA and in
the federal government it's CQV and it continues to fund government Why
do you think they don't care if they spend $3 trillion on foreign entities
because it's not their money It came out of your trusts It's not part of taxes In
fact if you took the entire federal budget how much is derived from taxes
and tariffs
if you call up the Department of Fiscal Services and you send a foyer request and you ask them who is the
largest contributor to the federal budget the
Department of Justice to the tune of $1 trillion
dollar a day is taken out of our cest trusts or our
court systems every day A trillion dollars That's more in 25 days than our
entire gross domestic product in a year In 25 days they don't have to
disclose the CQB See I had to prove this in federal
court to get to talk about it So a big portion of this comes out of
this before we die Every time you have a court case
the case is a cusup number The case number the court clerk is the banker
Mary at the ninth district of federal court I showed how upon indictment now
when someone gets indicted are they found guilty no No they're not found guilty They
haven't even been tried But upon
indictment upon indictment Mary
filled out the SF273
form with the Department of Fiscal Services which is called a bid bond form
She told the Department of Fiscal Services with this form to begin
liquidation of this person's account because we're going to need some of
it You got to remember they're in US Treasury bonds They're not liquid
capital They have to be sold off That takes a little bit of time
right so she filled out that form in this particular case in October
The trial was set for January Didn't happen until April
Upon the day of the trial the exact day of the trial Mary filled out the
SF 274 form with the Department of Fiscal
Services which is called a performance bond telling the Department of Fiscal
Services that this person has been found guilty and they will have to perform
That's what a performance bond is It's notifying someone that that you're going
to have to perform
Okay This was supposed to take place July 13th I pushed it to August
30th Mary filled out the
SF275 form which is the payment form It's no
different than a wire transfer order is would have told the department
of fiscal services to wire transfer that money to the court Now what money am I
talking about the amount the penal
sum So an indictment An
indictment is a bill True
bill If you don't pay the bill you're brought up on charges You're tried for those charges
This particular case the woman the grandmother had four felony counts of
fraud Each had a penal sum Each count had a penal sum of $2
million That's 8 million total In addition to that 8
million the judge was going to receive 95,000 in what they call net
retention and the prosecutor 50,000 per
count Four counts That's wrong Oh no because they share
that with the defense attorney that she had that she paid 27,000 out of her
pocket to represent her So what is the legal definition of
the word attorney anybody know not the ones that have watched my class
Got to watch him An actor to attorney The legal
definition of the word actor is someone who gets up on stage and lies convincingly enough to make you believe
in the character and the plot Therefore a liar What is to a
turnar to steal from one and turn over to another So by the very definition of
their profession they're liars and thieves See God only warned us about four professions in the Bible Do you
know what they were attorneys bankers attorneys tax collectors doctors
police and organized religion Why did he warn us about organized
religion joseph Smith warned the Mormon church about organized
religion He said that someday in the future it would be corrupted by
men He said that In fact he says "I doubt it will last 75 to 100
years." And he was right How many people are not brought up LDS in this room just
a couple Okay It's all right I'm going to talk talk to you about the
church I grew up LDS In fact my mother was born in
Lehi in a one room log cabin with a dirt pour on the Indian reservation Well her
dad taught English to the Indians here in
1917 My dad in the 50s right after he got out of the war in World War II he
was on a Navy in the USS Texas He ran the church welfare
ranches He was head of all the church welfare ranches My family has a long history
here Um the Bennett were the contractors for Brigham
Young They built Brigham Young's house David Bennett's name is on the church of
Bear Lake That's my grandfather on my mom's side My
grandmother was born somewhere in Nebraska along the Plat River in the back of a wagon on their way
here Okay So I printed off DNC98 What is the
doctrine and covenants doctrine is the laws the churches to live by Covenant is
a promise to live by those laws It's why it's called a doctrine and a covenant They promise to live by these laws
98 Just going to read a little bit And my eyes are bad So and the writing is
small I'm going to start with
uh verse three Therefore he giveth this promise unto you with an immutable
covenant that it shall be fulfilled and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your
good and to my name's glory sayeth the Lord And now verily I say unto you
concerning the laws of the land it is my will that my people should observe to do
all things whatsoever I command them that the law of the land which is
constitutional supporting the principles of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges belongs to all mankind and is
justifiable before me And then it moves
on Therefore I the Lord justify you and your brethren of my church in
befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land He says make it your
friend the constitutions That's our supreme
law And as pertaining to the law of man whatsoever is more or less than this
cometh of evil I the Lord God made you free therefore
you are free indeed and the law also maketh you free Nevertheless when the
wicked rule the people mourn Wherefore honest men and wise men should be sought
diligently and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold Otherwise whatsoever is less than this cometh of
evil Rules codes statutes and ordinances are not law What is the legal definition
of the word legal this is going to just kick your
butts when I tell you what the definition of the word legal is It is the undoing of God's law
What is legal is not lawful and what is lawful is not legal
Let that sink in for just a second What is legal is the undoing of
God's laws All throughout the Bible God taught us a lot of things And I studied the
Bible very very well for a lot of years And I went to every religion on earth
that I could go to I've been to China I've sat with the Buddhists I've been all over this world
When I was in intelligence with the government when they had something that dealt with religion they sent me
They sent me into the basement of the Vatican with a group of people to look
at the lost scrolls And we brought out the United States
government brought out of the basement the Mcabes Esther the wisdom of Solomon many
books of the Bible that weren't in the Bible Okay and there's many more down
there Many more The the Catholic Church suppressed us like you wouldn't believe
They kept so many things hidden from us There are books of the Bible that reveal exactly what is happening in this world
today and we recorded it and we know what it
is And uh anyway I'll go into some more off
camera but what I'm trying to tell you I quit going to church 20 years
ago Doesn't mean I don't believe in the basic core teachings of this church I do
I think they're the best family oriented most common sense church on the
face of the planet But I also know just like Joseph Smith knew that men would corrupt it at
the highest levels Exactly Exactly And all you have to do is ask
yourself who of the prophet and the twel apostles are lawyers
that's all you have to ask Okay
When I gave that talk in church I was removed from the stand hauled to the
bishop's office talked to and I never went
back Okay That's right
That's right Tell an attorney that statutes aren't law That what's legal is
the undoing of God's laws He He never learned that in law school So they base everything on a
penal sum No matter what crime it is you have it's commercial All crimes are
commercial So they get paid a net retention Our Department of Justice collects the majority of our federal
budget through our cus numbers out of our
susta program the federal court clerks If you look at
Portland Oregon's building that pretty much Antifa destroyed the federal courthouse in Portland but it's a
fivestory building with two more stories below ground
Okay Judge Mosman he he's no longer there but he had the top four him and
his aids US Marshall Service has a bottom floor
down the basement That's the Marshalss Then there's two more floors
of judges and courtrooms Two floors All the rest of this building are
court quirks Court quirks Why do they need
hundreds i mean they're in cubicles Why do they need This building covers an entire city
block It's a big building Why do they need so many court clerks they're like
tellers They're bank tellers Mary the head court clerk
Mary runs all the tellers She's the bank president She handles all the bonds The
federal courts buy all the state bonds So everything that happens in the ninth
district which is California Nevada Oregon Washington Idaho
Montana anything that happens in any of those state courts under the GSAs the federal government buys them
The federal court buys them from the states That's what funds the
states and then they collect out of our trusts through the Department of Fiscal
Services So those people are sitting there in their cubicles typing on the
computer and they're filling out the SF273 274 and 275 forms all day long
for Yeah It's a bank So when these uh blue and white lights
come on behind you and you got that policy enforcement revenue collection agent behind
you who the Supreme Court says has no obligation to protect you No it's not
their duty It is not the police officer's duty to protect you Their job title is a policy revenue collection
agent They're they're to help fund the counties and the cities and the state They presume you're a citizen or person
or resident Your status This is called status Anybody
know what status is did you know there was more than
one geez They just didn't want you to know this crap do they see in title 8
section 1101 of the United States Code it it says definitions of
statuses These are the definitions of status that the United States government
accepts right you can be a US citizen or a US national or state citizen or a
state national or a variety of other things that they accept
But what are you taught just to be the one that they have control
over Isn't that crazy it is status They presume your status This government
works off of unrebuted
presumption Unrebuted presumption They steal your house by making a lot of
clerical errors and you don't correct them and you acquance You just pay the
bills and you don't correct those errors and they stole it from you on behalf of the state
They steal your car when you go to the dealership and buy one by
making a statement with a clerical errors that you fill out you sign you consent to and
then they stole your car and you didn't even know it You come
home you tell your family "Look at my new car
Smell good Smell." Got that new car smell so nice It's the states You don't
have the MSO or the MCO Now they assume you did something
wrong You did 70 and a 55 Doesn't matter what it is They assume
you did something wrong They get your tacid agreement of you being a citizen a person a
resident and then they get up on stand and they
lie and your attorney sits there and says "Shh don't say anything We'll get
our chance later." And then the hammer gets dropped and every lie that they said became truth and fact upon the
record You acquance to it and your attorney knew that
He knows he's supposed to object to everything they say and he sat there and he was quiet and he told you not to
speak because you can't They can't hear you anyway You know a judge can't hear you in court
No they summons you into court What is a summon it's a seance They're wearing
black robes This is a satanic ritual They summon you into court A seance
calling the dead into court And there's two ways for you to appear in court
There's only two It's in the law There's general appearance That's where you just show up
generally and you ex you accept jurisdiction by just showing
up I get your tacit agreement of you being a citizen personal resident You just show
up They call the dead into court and there you are They call out your all caps name and you don't say "No that's
not me your honor That's my vessel I take ownership
of that vessel I claim the minor estate You don't say any of that First words out of your mouth in a
courtroom should be what okay I'm sitting down in the back row
Judge walks in Bailiff says "All rise." I lean back on my chair and I put my
feet up I sure ain't going to stand when he walks in That's giving him
jurisdiction When an employee walks into the room does this boss stand no He's my
public servant I have to take control of the court immediately He's If you stand you're the
employee He's the boss He's getting your tacid agreement You're turning over
jurisdiction to him Uh were you in Logan at the at Cody's
deal where we had about 60 people there okay We had about 60 people in Cody
Smith's court case in Logan Utah And I met with everybody before we
went and I told them not only do not stand when the judge walks in but I want
you to make a concerted effort to lean back and put your feet up
And they did There was only one reporter on the other side that stood up Nobody
else did And then in one voice when they
started running over the top of Cody we all said "Let him
speak in one
voice." and Cody got to speak The entire court changed What I tell people is
rally the troops Get them in there on your behalf If you can get at least 25
people in the audience doing what I've just telling you to do when you stand up up there say "I'm here by special divine
appearance your honor to call for a constitutional court of record and I brought a grand jury
with me of my peers."
What is the definition of peers likeminded individuals No here's one
that's really got screwed up by our bar
association When you call for a jury trial or a trial by jury what's the
difference do you guys know always call for a trial by
jury Why call for a trial by jury trial by jury would not be
the Yeah but the trial by jury the jury decides your fate a jury trial the judge can override
the jury's decision and do whatever he wants and they will try and force you into a jury
trial They will
Now here's a definition twist on the word peers
The definition of the word peers is someone from your own neighborhood who
knows your character and your situation in life For only then can you truly
judge a man What do they get they question the jury because they
don't want anybody that even knows you They want people from other counties other areas of the state
They want to rig the trial to railroad
you To railroad is to lead somebody down a narrow path or rail to a predetermined
outlook or conclusion And that's the
path Did that make any sense yet oh the fraud in which we perceive
right it's ridiculous And when you stand up from that back row when they call your name and the very first words out
of your mouth when you stand up and you take your first step is I'm here by special divine appearance judge to
settle this matter to call for a constitutional court of record to ask
for a summary judgment upon the truth and facts placed upon this record by my documents and I stand firmly upon my
rights Can I get that summary judgement your honor
this thing is over with They can't give you they have to to do a summary
judgement The rule of three rule of three applies applies in
all things celestial terrestrial and tstal
Right there's a rule of three You have to ask them three times
And if they have an important question they're supposed to ask you three times And if
not you can say "What did you say again?" See
how does a judge derive their authority since you brought it up
number one from his oath
Oath of office can't
write and any other
requirements by the
state to hold office His oath and any other requirements by the state to hold
office That's how he derives his authority Second he deres his authority
by statute What did I say a minute ago it's
the worst looking e I've ever seen in my life
The rules codes statutes and ordinances are not law
Third he derives his authority through parents
patre See my first three questions the very first document I submit if we have
to go to court is a notice of appearance A notice of
appearance I'm gonna say "Hey I received this seance in the mail where you're
calling the dead entity into court and I'm willing to appear to settle this matter but I'm going to do
it by special divine appearance as a living
soul." See what does Genesis 2:7 say
bible scholars in this room I see that Genesis 2:7 says I'm not trying to give
you a hard time It's just kind of fun But uh and I God created man from the dust
of the earth and I breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul Are we man or are
we living souls we're living souls Our bodies are made up of what
energy The dust of the earth And they're held together by energy the energy of our soul the
celestial testral and terrestrial souls which by the way they're here
helping us right now in a big way
Exactly I'm just here to settle this matter as the executive to the trust So therefore
it's not Yeah that vessel that they can arrest and do
all these things to if it was there What I'm doing is breaking through their veil
They're not allowed to even talk to me as a man They're not even allowed to
talk to me I'm going to break through their veil and educate them Create that barrier that because if if you did
something as the vessel now you are that ward of the court You now the sheriff takes you away You're in that system Ah
what did I say genesis 1:26-28 God gave me man dominion over
the land the air and the water And this is law I'm going to show you how to take dominion this weekend And when you take
dominion over all three jurisdictions you are free If you jump out of one into
another with both feet they'll destroy you in the other two
All these wonderful patriot groups out there I love them
But they're trying to jump out of two jurisdictions into one And they go to
jail over and over over again I've watched them do it for 35 years And then I watch the people behind them not stand
up for him when they get there And I'll I can show you how to be
free So you never never get into that position Okay
That's probably a good time So I form three questions out of this to the judge in my notice of a
special appearance I say "Judge or your
honor do you claim to derive your authority over me based upon your oath
of office and any other requirement of the state yes or no
may I have a copy of those to make sure that they're up to date and current before I arrive into
court because if he doesn't have his current oath on file the way he's supposed to and they seldom do
case dismissed Judge do you claim to derive
your authority over me based upon statute yes or no
i'm setting him up I'm pinning him in a
corner because he's going to answer yes Of course I do Great Then where's my
paycheck stubs where's my company car where's my 401k you're claiming I'm a
I'm an employee of the state of the county of the city Where's my paycheck stubs i think
you owe me a bunch How much do you make how much these state employees get paid for driving a car around paid for
by the state Can they get you on contempt for that i'm not at war See that's another thing
What is a war rant it's a a warrant What is a warrant it's
a war rant It's a declaration of war They're declaring war upon you I'm at
peace On my house I fly the civil flag of peace I walk into the courtroom with
the flag of peace on my document What's the flag of peace they can't
declare war on me when I'm at peace They can't hold me for contempt when I'm at peace This is just a
discussion and they can't out debate me Is it a physical flag that you have
What does it look like Gosh you all think we have one flag in this country
we have lots of flags The red white and blue that you all see is our war flag
We have a peace flag too And it's red and white vertical stripes
with a white background with blue stars Look at the Look at the United States
Coast Guard's flag It's a civil flag of peace because they were developed as a civil organization and then they put
their logo in the middle of it and they called it the Coast Guard flag but it's on a civil flag of peace
For three years in this country this country was at peace and we flew the civil flag over all of our commerce
buildings and our capitals Really three years
A long time ago brother We have been at war ever since especially since rotten
Lincoln stinking Lincoln communist follower of
Carl Marx failed five times to run for as president because nobody wanted him
Wasn't until the big bankers of Boston New York Chicago and Philadelphia got behind and put seven million in his
campaign that he finally won And then he couldn't be president of the desure United States of America So he
bankrupted and formed a Delaware Corporation and he made him put the Grand Army of the Republic in charge of
the United States and then he made himself commander-in-chief and that's why every president since has been sworn in as commander-in-chief as well as the
president of the corporation President Trump is the first man that
restored the republic by executive order In fact June
22nd of 2019 in the Rose Garden he gave me that hat One more reason why they're against
me Explain that again And he told me "I restored the Republic
and now it's up to you." And if you look at all his executive orders I don't care whether you're a
Trump fan or not but if you're not you will be by the end of this [Laughter]
weekend Because every executive order he has written goes something like this I
Donald J Trump is president of the United States of America That's our
desure government Take back our utilities from the United States
which is the corporation Do you know what he just did and people read that
and they don't even know jurisdiction See they don't even know what he did And he's done that over and
over and over again on behalf of the people He just keeps restoring the republic over and over and over again
right now he's destroying the WHO and Fouchy and the CDC and the and the
pharmaceutical companies He's destroying Western medicine
He's destroying it all on behalf of you Yes He signed four executive orders and
then he had to hop on an airplane for fear he'd be shot They always try to kill him Five times
in the last week Five attempts Five in the last week Yep just in the
last week Yeah they're not grasping for straw They
got to shut him down That's right He knows it And he's got
the best Secret Service agents this history has ever seen Those boys are
tough If not he'd be dead I've heard rumors
take the go to your bank and see how much coins they have See our coinage
He took back for the United States of America The Fed doesn't have access to
it There's a ton going on I I know IRS agents that have already received their pink slip and been told to look for
another job Okay Federal Reserve got into the wage and income tax has never
been legal It's always been a gift Abe Lincoln did the 1040 bonds The 1040 is
still here You consent to it by filling it out and signing it and sending it in By your own consent admission you pay
taxes Nobody at the IRS can figure out why you keep sending
them in They just can't figure that out But you just keep doing it and they keep getting that gift and they love every
minute of it Okay Judge do you claim to derive your authority over me based upon the
doctrine of parents patry yes or no they don't want to answer that question So I
said "Judge yes or
no judge I need an answer to that question
Yes or no you don't want them to get away with okay they're your public servants
Take control of the courtroom because he's going to assert that he doesn't have to answer to you Yeah he absolutely
does He absolutely does He lost all immunity He tries to take back command
of that court Look you know I'm the only state in the United States I've never been in is West
Virginia Do you know I helped remove the entire Supreme Court of West Virginia off the bench a couple years ago was in
all the papers I've never even been in that state
But they were doing a lot of people harm So we got them off the bench They lose their
immunity when they step outside of the scope and authority of the law in which we the people lay
down The minute they step outside of that scope and authority they lost their immunity As long as they're operating
inside that they're immune We can't touch them We can't sue them But if we can prove all the laws they create
Okay this is the most important question You got to get them to answer these three questions You get them to answer
Judge do you claim to derive your authority over me based upon your oath of office statute parents
Patrick you got to get them to answer it Once you do you can destroy the case
with those three questions Because if I'm not a citizen person or
resident they have no authority over me the statute I have limited diplomatic immunity
Do you need to ask each of those limited diplomatic immunity that means if I don't kill someone or rape someone or
injure another human being I am immune from any statute The only thing I can be
held accountable of is harming someone else Love thy neighbor do no harm That's
that's our motto Okay we're at peace We love thy neighbor and do no harm Does
being at peace mean we can't shoot them in the head when they try and steal our kids no it does not You are protecting
your That's right In fact most states have the imminent
domain or castle laws Our home is our castle Okay Now should we give them fair
warning yes we should It's what no trespassing signs are for That's why you
don't open your door You don't step out on the threshold to talk to them You
hand them a little warning notice through the door while it's still chained and you close the door and you
lock it behind you and then they get to read And if you wrote that notice
properly they'll get in their car and they'll drive off and they won't come see you again Three very very important
questions and sometimes you must ask it three times So so if they refuse you say
"All right your honor I've asked you three times You've refused to answer
This case is now dismissed without prejudice." And you walk out the door and don't look back Will you do all
this as you start walking up as you're walking up if you're sitting
in the back row and they call your name the minute you take your first step
I'm here by special divine appearance your honor to call for a constitutional court of record before you even get
through that bar Okay Okay Otherwise you probably got chance right
right Well you got to Well you have to establish your status
standing and jurisdiction So let's talk about that status We already did a little bit
standing jurisdiction I'm going to write it way
over here Why do I do that
first of all the bar association misuses the word jurisdiction on purpose to
confuse the public It's probably the most misused word in the legal
arena Okay the legal stage Why do I say that because I've
already told you what the three jurisdictions are Land air and water
It's trust law equity law contract
law That's our three jurisdictions What does the word jurist mean it means
right law What does the word diction mean
you look words up in a dictionary don't you the words you use determines the right
law under which you stand So if I say I'm a
party what law am I under the jurisdiction of the water I'm
a party to a contract If I say I'm a trustee what jurisdiction am I under the
air If I say I'm a owner who holds superior
title I'm in the jurisdiction of land April the 22nd I put on a class at
the Department of Justice in Washington DC in front of a whole group of young
lawyers William Barer actually set that up for me
Okay And I put on a class similar to what I'm putting on now
But I didn't have as much time So I had to cram it in really fast and in a very
specific order But I taught them 1 plus 1 is two They didn't know that They
didn't know the basics of law They're out there trying to do
algebra and they don't even know 1 plus 1 is two So I asked him where what is the law
where did it come from where's its origins how did we arrive at this thing called law where a small group of men
could put something down on paper and hold me a man accountable and I stood there like
this You could have heard a pin drop They couldn't come up with an
answer They said "Oh one one kid piped up and says "Oh it's Bill on Capitol
Hill." And you know that little cartoon thing he was repeating that I just
went and then I told him about Genesis 1:26-28 and I told them the basics of
law and I taught them about jurisdiction See they thought it was in the city's jurisdiction or the county's
jurisdiction or the state's jurisdiction or the federal governments or this agency or that agency They thought that
was what jurisdiction means No that's venue Who has the authority over in that
location is venue jurisdiction is do they have
authority in and in which law do do they
have authority so after I got done this young attorney came up 29 years old He looked
like he was 12 He was a grandson of a judge and the son of a judge long line of judges very
smart man He could rattle things off like you wouldn't believe it But he thanked me for what I had
taught And he said "Can I tell you a story?" And I said "Sure." He says "When he was 16 years
old and his dad was teaching at Georgetown Law he got to go and sit in
one of his dad's classes and his dad taught law just like I
did Land air and water
And he says "But he said it a little bit differently than you did." And I said "Well how did he say it?" Because I took
several hours to talk about it He says "He he he said it in a few minutes." And I said "Well then I want to know because
I've been doing this like 35 years right and the first 20 years I made it really complicated and I could talk really fast
and I would just blow people's minds and none of them would listen and I'd have a group of 20 people and then a year later
I'd go back and I'd still have the same group of 20 people I go "This isn't
working." About the noisiest little go-kart I've ever heard Anyway I said "This isn't working
If I'm going to get the same people year after year the same 20 this isn't going to work How can I wake up America?"
Right And he said this He says "When a man walks into a courtroom the very
first thing he sees when he walks in is a little sign up on the judge's desk
that says "Your honorable Bob Smith," or whatever the judge's name happens to be The reason it says
honor is because you can't have honor without trust You can't have trust without honor Which form of law is trust
law the jurisdiction the highest form of law It is superior law There is nothing
more important in the law than having a fidiciary responsibility for the benefit of
another Okay so he said this the very first job title hat the judge puts on
when he walks in the room is your honor hat The very first thing he's going to
administer the first jurists he's going to administer is the jurisdiction of the
heir He wants to see if the man walked in with his express trust in
hand There's two types of trusts
Express and implied This is written and this is
unwritten And if the man doesn't walk in with his express trust in hand then the judge is
going to imply a trust where he's the executive and you're the trustee who
somehow mismanaged the trust on behalf of the beneficiary who's the prosecution or whoever is bringing the
case And therefore you owe the prosecution something for your
mismanagement What is a misdemeanor by the way what is
demeanor it's your attitude It's a miss You got a bad attitude go sit in the
corner You got a misdemeanor You got the wrong attitude That's what a contempt charge is It's a
misdemeanor Right All right Words are important and we just don't understand
them Never taught English at school It's why it's why attorneys have a whole
separate word for it They call it legal ease Legal ease is a separation of words
in the English language into one of three
juris So if I'm a driver or an operator of a motor vehicle upon the
highways I have to have a driver's license But if I'm traveling in private
upon the high on the roadways in my private automobile all I need is my
passport See the difference in the words they both mean going down the street in a car Both those
sentences say but the word you use determines the jury you're under And
it's up to you to determine your own words Most people get their That's right
They open their mouth Yeah You have the right to remain silent Everything you say can and
absolutely will be used against you Okay And they'll bait you Those cops
will go "Now are you driving that automobile?" No they won't say that
They'll ask you if you're operating that motor vehicle Right so if the man walks in with his
express trust in hand that clearly states who the executive is who the
trustee is has an acceptance of the trustee to be the trustee that's so they can't break the
trust veil It's important tells who the beneficiary is what property the trust
is managing and how it's supposed to be managed for who the heirs
then there's nothing for him to adjudicate He can't imply a trust if
there's an express trust in hand He has to go by the express trust
And you know what trusts are private You don't have to show the judge a trust He
he does not need to read it All you have to do is walk in and you say
"Judge you can't imply a trust when I have an express trust that clearly
states who the executive is who the trustee is has an acceptance of the trustee to be the trustee It tells who
the heirs are and the beneficiaries what property is supposed to be managed by the trust and how the trust is supposed
to be managed And then you just set it back down on your table."
He can't adjudicate it So he has to take that hat
off And he puts on his judge
hat Now he's looking to see if there's a victim If there's a victim there's a crime It's going to trial Physical
injury to another If there's not it's civil
turns his head around and he's looking to see if the
man walked in with his superior titles in hand Wait a minute If it's a automobile
case do you have your MSO or MCO and you walk in with it if you don't he's going to imply the
state has a certificate of title The state owns it and he's going to regulate
you and you're guilty
Ah you see now let's say it's a foreclosure If you walk in like Ken
Cromer did with his land patent after I taught him how to do it and his grant
deeds and his superior titles in hand they can't imply an abstracted
title So Ken gets to move back in his house Okay
What about your life if you walk in having claimed your minor estate and
taken ownership of your birth certificate in hand and you now own the vessel you're
not just a signatory officer See what is a person a person is
an office of the vessel That's your job title You're an employee as a person
That's why every state statute starts off by saying all persons must do this and all
persons must do that and all persons must do this They don't say all men and women must do this They can't regulate a
man or a woman They can't regulate somebody alive You can only regulate a dead
entity a vessel a person a signatory officer If I'm a man and I write my
autobiography which is the story of my life and I go to the bookstore and sell it and people line up to buy my
book do I put my signature on it or I sign my autograph a man signs his
autograph and he does it on this side of the paper A signator goes on this side of
the paper A trustee signs in the
middle A signatory signs in blue with black
ink A man signs in red A trustee having
fidiciary responsibility signs in
purple Guys don't know the law There's three jurisdictions There's three places for a signature There should be three
seals Do you have your own seal for each of your
jurisdictions guess you're not free
Okay So if you have all your superior titles
in hand and you stand firmly upon your rights there's nothing for him to adjudicate So he takes his judge hat off
and he puts on his Mr Administrator hat Okay Now he wants to see if you have
your business affairs in order He's looking at the jurisdiction of the water He wants to see contracts He wants to see your business
affairs Think Michael Jordan and Nike for just a minute Michael Jordan signed
a five-year contract with Nike for a billion dollars $200 million a
year just so they could use his name
It's a good gig if you can get it right
during that time a police officer couldn't even write Michael Jordan's name on a ticket without the prior express written permission of Nike or
Michael Jordan See they can regulate commerce
but they can't interfere in it Title 15 of the United States Code becomes your
savior because it says any documents that they used your trademark name on
must be destroyed So that ticket goes through a paper
shredder You want to trademark your name
Absolutely You want to trademark your name So how do you take dominion over your three jurises is first you do a
trust and and now I'm going to back up You have to take status first You got to
claim who you are Claim your status
Did we make enough copies of those pass one of those out to everybody You have to claim your status
Status standing and jurisdiction is everything in the law
Everything You have to know who you are and what's status Maximal law again is that in
which one creates one controls As a state national I'm one of
we the people who created government Guess what i control
government Government created the US citizen Guess who they control you the
US citizen Say we're not free in this
country As long as you self-determine that you're a US citizen you are not
free Now is there anything wrong with being a US citizen
yeah there is That was a trick question I was throwing out there
Yeah So you need to do your trust to take dominion over the
air You need to have your superior
titles and know your rights
to take dominion over the
land Now Michael Jordan and Nike that's what I was on that story Let me ask you a question CPS
comes in people's houses every day and they steal kids They kidnap kids as a
private for-profit entity not government
Half the people I talk to are not bad parents Now every once in a while
there's a drug dealer or somebody like that that needs their kids taken from them Who should take them a church or a
family member It's not up to government Government shouldn't even be
involved in the family unit at all Zero None They have
no business being in your family Okay
none I get sometimes 70 to 100 phone calls a day from parents all over this
country whose children have been taken every day day in day out
I was with her yesterday and I got a phone call to
listen their story Brought me to tears didn't it not many people can handle those kind
of
stories What if I had a business ABC Inc
licensed by the Secretary of State's office bonded with a gold and silver
which I like to
use One of the number one ways the government gets you is by being a popper
I don't care how big a stack of this crap you have in your pocket That's legal tender
It does not discharge a debt It tenders it to a later
date When the probate of the balance sheet of the CES QB trust gets probated
the debts get paid This never pays off a debt It
tenders it to a later
date But that does
And if you've got a silver or a gold coin on you they can never deem you a
popper And if you look in the law what a popper means every US citizen is deemed
a popper therefore a debtor And they can never deem you a popper if you've got a little gold and a
little silver on you In my pickup truck I carry a little
jeweler's sack with 40 pieces of silver on the
door They can never deem me a popper But it doesn't Good man
But it gives them control You're unable to handle your own affairs
See who if you look up in the law who can an attorney represent they can represent an entity a
corporation or a vessel They can represent a minor They can represent someone incompetent or somebody infirmed
They can represent a ward of the court and a ward of the state or a popper
Did I leave some words out see they can't represent a man or a woman
Yeah they can't represent a man or a woman It takes three signatures to put
you in jail Did you know that and if they don't have those three you can't go
to jail Anybody know Gina Nielson over in uh Cash County Utah
i met Gina after her trial She was found guilty by a jury and she was going to be sentenced
to 15 years in the state prison By the way Gina got held in
contempt and thrown in jail for a little bit but that's not a prison sentence
That's a misdemeanor and it's go sit in the corner You've been naughty
But she never spent one day in jail and she never will Her case has been
dismissed Why because I told her they require three signatures to put you in jail
Gina They require yours by taking a plea the prosecutors and the judges or
your attorney who will sign as your power of attorney on your behalf and throw you in
jail So it takes one of three signatures the judges the prosecutors and either
yours or your attorney It's why they try and force you to have an attorney because you're incompetent You're
infirmed You're unable to speak for yourself You're a citizen a person a resident You're not
suejurous What does suejurus mean of one's own right i walk in the courtroom sue
jurist and they can't even speak to me I have to tell them what to do
say they might argue with me a little bit but they never win They can't win
It's impossible for them to win when you're
serious When you've taken dominion over your three jurisdictions they can't win
So let's get back to Michael Jordan and Nike What if you ha owned your children you took
ownership of their vessels as your biner children and you held them in trust and you trademarked or
patented or did both your children See what is the jurisdiction of
the water it's commerce right it's contracts
and commerce It's corporate
bylaws It's
banking but most important it's contract law
So if I had a business ABC Inc licensed with the state bonded with gold and
silver and I went to the United States Patent and Trademark Office website and on their TE's plus form I trademarked my
vessels mine my kids my families doing under a bulk trademark
under that business name and I took ownership of that meaning their names
business name all cap's name their vessel name the one that's on their birth certificate get Okay we're talking about taking
control of their vessel because that's what the courts care about That's what they have parents patri over
right you have parental rights over your living children The problem is you don't have any living children They're all
dead entities to the state See so they take control over the vessel through
parents patray But if I take control over the vessel and I own my property
which is my children they're a gift from God to me okay and I patent them and I on the
land I put them in trust as a fidiciary and I trademark them in with my
business And my business has a EIN number and a bank account and a product
offered for sale in international commerce And my business
has the intent to make a profit And I go out and I put my
children's names on t-shirts my name on a t-shirt and their names on a t-shirt
just like Michael Jordan's name on a Nike t-shirt and I offer them for sale on a website for
$19.95 I'd make it 21.95 There's a little key about getting over 20 bucks
Okay So I offer for sale for over 20 bucks on the internet and I walk into court wearing
one of those t-shirts and this is a child protection services case
And I say I don't talk about the facts of the case because in reality in their courts no truth or fact shall be tried
in court It's all based upon presumption assumption task agreement and hearsay That's their motto No truth or
fact shall be tried in court Okay And I walk in there and I say
"Uh you can't interfere in commerce your honor You can only regulate
it You're interfering in a trademark I demand the return of my
property my trademarked property and any document that idiot prosecutor put that
name on without my express written prior permission I demand for it to be destroyed under USC title
15 Case dismissed So you walk in with your
superior titles You walk in with your express trust You walk in with your business affairs in order And there's
nothing left for them to adjudicate Case dismissed
I just told you how to win every lawsuit every time they come against you But you
have to get your affairs in order You have to claim your status You have to
set up your trust You have to record your superior titles and get hold of them and record them Anyway just curious
Your offer to contract is not accepted So would you ignore it not pay it you
have a 72-hour right of recision You ignore anything you're in trouble Never ignore anything Okay that's what I
thought Everything is banking laws If your credit card company sends
you out a bill an invoice you take it and you say "All right I'll get to that and I'll pin it up on my fridge." And I
forget about it Right then what do they do they send you a pass due notice because you had 30 days to pay that bill
You had 72 hours first to resend the contract once you filled out the credit card application You had 72 hours to
stop it You didn't You got the card in the mail You went out and spent some money Then they sent you a bill You got
30 days to pay it If you don't pay it they give you a 15-day past due notice
You got 15 days to pay it At the 16th day they cancel your credit card and
they send you to collections
If you know anything about contracts there's no privity of contract with a collection agent Okay so let's say you
owe a medical bill at the hospital and you can't pay it So they send it for collections They
do this every day of the week right to just about everybody And you can't pay it And a
collection agency goes to the hospital and buys that debt for 50 cents on the dollar And then they try and collect
from you man they call you up on the phone You know what I say i have a totally different conversation with them than
you do You run over the top of me I say "Oh
my gosh did you purchase that debt from the hospital?" And they say "Well yes we
did." I say "Thank you very much I really needed that help in my life at this time Thank you for doing that." But
you and I there's no privity of contract
But I appreciate it And I'm done Does that So does it work
different if it's like those are governmentbacked
pay for them with your sust
He He just shakes his head and puts his head down Did you see that no Wait a minute Don't Don't go any further yet
Wait a minute I said "Pay for him with your CESTV
trust." And what was your thought when you when I said that and you just kind of closed up and put your head down
See we the people need to make friends with the
United States Code The United States Code was put into place for one reason one reason only and
that's for us to hold our public servants accountable In USC
50 there Title 50 there is a way to pay your debts with your Sustic UV
trust You're the creditor but you can't do it if you're a
citizen caveat You have to become a state national You have to become one of we
the people There's not many of us left I think we've created about 40,000 we the
peoples in this country Maybe a little more than that That was probably a year ago's figure And that's it out of 337
million Because every contract written is written by an attorney And do
you ever look at a document that's written by an attorney and it's got lines on it and it's got little boxes on
it and things are boxed out See they know English language They know legal
ease They know styles and they write contracts to
eliminate the liability from the person paying them to write the contract and
place that liability upon you So they wrote you an unfair contract and
what you didn't do is walk in sit down with them get an agreement on how much
to pay and how much to pay you were going to pay and how much your down was and then go home and write the contract
bring it back and say "Here here's my contract Sign this [Music]
and you didn't do it." See you could have wrote a fair and honest contract
but you didn't And so they took advantage of you because you didn't know
any better How many law classes did you have kindergarten through 12th grade see I say that over and over again because
nobody does And that's why when I was telling you the story about Justin in the Space
Needle in Seattle and his his buddy that came over that
hired him says "Who do you think controls it all we write all the contracts We write all the sales
literature We write all the invoices We write we do this We do that We do it all
The bar association runs the world." And who are they
do you know who they are british The British Accreditation Registry The
United States of America has a treaty 1947 with the bar to operate upon these
shores Wasn't the first one That's the newest one Our country back way back then Okay If if you if you go to the
communist country of Illinois that Abraham Lincoln used to run if you go to their website you look
under the office of the attorney general of the state of Illinois and you click on the history tab it says the attorney
general's office of the state of Illinois was put into place to protect and uphold the interests of the crown
Isn't the attorney general the highest lawyer in the land of Illinois and it was put into place to
protect and uphold the interest of the crown The British accreditation registry
is under the crown under the US Wouldn't that be treason hold on a minute
No we adopted it You acquanced You haven't fought to change
it No I'm just saying Okay When I say you I I'm not pointing directly at you
Okay No here here's the issue The issue is they're supposed to register under
the Foreign Agents Registration Act under FAR They
don't The British Accreditation Registry You walk into a courtroom right here in
Utah and if you're not a member of the bar they're not going to let you talk for somebody else right i can't go in
and represent her unless I'm a member of the bar in Utah They'll say "No." Great Show me
where a bar licensed attorney is licensed by the state of
Utah They aren't They're licensed by the bar It's a labor union It's no different
than IBW Electrical Workers Credit Union
So they don't have any more jurisdiction than you no none whatsoever Except that's what that satanic cult called a
court operates The bar is Satan
guys And five or six of those members are the head of the church
Yeah You wonder why Utah's all screwed up church huh
yeah What I'm What I'm trying to trying to say here is we need to take
our country back as we the people And we're at war with the bar
association And people don't even realize that And some of our friends and our family and our next door neighbors
are attorneys And you know what the sad thing is they don't
know Everybody is a compartmentalized legal
idiot Everybody I don't care what job you have You go to work every day and you
just do your job and you have no idea what's going on over here or what's
going on over here See if I laid the map of Utah out here
and this is Utah the land the geographical area map and I drew a land patent on that map
and I put your home in that land patent where you got it through a grant
deed then you actually have a superior title and you own that land that home
But if I come in and I put a clear piece of plastic over the top and I do things like change your
name to all caps and I change your address and
instead of land patent number 4361 I put lot three of block 27 of Spring Hill
subdivision and I redescribe your property and I take it out of meets and bounds and I make all kinds of clerical
errors ers and you come in and I send you those clerical errors on your tax invoice and
you just write a check and send it back Guess what i just stole your property on
behalf of the state and you accept it And until you come back and call
fraud and correct the errors and educate me so I never do it again because see it
took a lot of people It took a cgrapher It took a appraiser It took a tax
assessor It took a county recorder It took a real estate agent a title company
an attorney Blah blah blah It took all these compartmentalized legal idiots to create a conspiracy to deprive
me of my land And every one of them was just
doing their job But when you add them all up and put the results together that's exactly what
they did is they stole my home on behalf of the state and they didn't even know
it So I'm not saying rush in and declare war on them and start yelling at them
and tell them everything they did wrong You got to correct all the errors
and then educate them We're seeing that now Yeah
That's exactly what they're doing These damn sheep around here that are wearing masks are killing this country
The recovery rate for CO That's
right Less than the common cold lessen the flu lessen H1N1 lessen all the
things we've had over the years Why we weren't in fear of it then Why are we in
fear of it now how many people know somebody that died from it i'm doing nine lawsuits right now Nine lawsuits of
family members that have died of COVID One of them died in a motorcycle accident
One of them had stage four breast cancer was with hospice for longer than she was supposed to live but because they list
COVID on her death certificate she gets cremated
She had a plot already paid for next to her husband
and her family is pissed and they want to sue
all nine of them Their deaths were listed as CO and none of them died from CO
What is COVID 19
okay that's one term for it
It's C The sheep surrender
19 is the code word for surrender in the in the military If I yell out an order code 19 Code 19
That means my guys on the front line are supposed to wave a white flag
So what's that mean this is the ancient Greek word for sheep
This is a military code The disease was called SARS Corona 2
Why did they change the name in the 2019 perspectus of the WHO
which was written in 2018 it described everything that's going on right now to a tea And this
disease wasn't even here supposedly going clear back to 2003
So what did you say this has been planned Old old Greek or what sheep
Okay It's all a barse Is the d is the disease real yes it is Yes Okay What
does corona mean corona Corona is a crown It's an energy
crown Okay It is a
bacteria This whole germ theory thing has been debunked guys that you cannot
pass COVID or corona whatever you want to name it You can't pass it this way
you The mask does nothing but harm you for wearing it More people are now going
to the hospital from the mask than were would have went for CO Okay Lot of staff infections a lot of
things The N95 mask OSHA will tell you that it would it's only good in a
sterile environment That means an operating room Once out of the operating room the
doctors remove it throw in the trash It's only good in a sterile
environment This ain't a sterile environment Okay it's not meant to
be We have immune systems The best way for us to be immune
from disease is to touch things and get it on us And then our
body fights it off and it builds up an immunity I haven't got sick in 40 years I'm immune to everything I live in
horseshit Okay People are dying right now from hand sanitizer They're getting
the hand sanitizer that has methol in it which almost all of them do and they're getting them on their hands They're
absorbing it through their skin and they're just dying from hand sanitizer Bleaches and hand sanitizer are one of
the largest destruction of mankind there is I'm the youngest of eight kids I got
one sister who is a neat clean freak She's older than I am now She spends all
day in her retirement driving her kids and her grandkids to the doctors She's got the sickest family
I've ever seen The rest of the seven kids we all have farms We all play in the
We travel the world We touch things We seldom wash our hands And we never get
sick You could eat underneath her sink off the floor She bleaches everything
Everything is sanitized in her house She's got the cleanest house in the face of this
earth And they're all sick all the time We are creating a whole
generation of weak people and that's what they want Bill Gates would like to
see a one-third to one half reduction in the number of people on this earth You
know he's committed genocide Yes Genocide India Well in India he didn't
commit genocide but he killed over 400,000 people In Africa he actually
committed genocide There's an entire race of Africa Africans who can never
have children and once they die off they cease to exist
They're sterile because of his malaria drug had a sterilization component in
it Okay the drug they're trying to produce right
now for this that they're scaring everybody that they're getting children used to having a gun pointed at their
head pointing at their penal gland with these temperature things That's right They're
they're getting you indoctrinated for destruction
Okay The guy that made the chip the way they keep the battery going on the chip
is they have to put it in one of two places where the temperature changes the most Right there in the hand or right
there in the forehead Can't put it in their forehead because everybody will see it and it'll look ugly So they're
going to put it right here in your hand And the natural temperature change of your this part of your hand keeps the
battery going
You'll be able to walk up and pay for things with your hand Gosh you see the employees at that
Wisconsin company lining up to get a jet Take the mark of the beast in your
hand Read what it says about that in the Bible And you go straight to
hell There ain't no forgiveness for that sin Says it right in the Bible
Okay don't do it Defend your family your family's
life It's their salvation Eternal salvation is at stake Okay All right I
feel like a preacher They don't mean to be a preacher but that's what tends to happen with thisthis diagram is from the United States Patent and Trademark
Office it is the blueprint of a marriage
did you know the states patented a marriage
yeah for all those thinking about getting married or are married this is for you
for those that are divorced it's still for you see the
state is the primary in the contract the
state joins with the
husband and then enjoins with the wife
there is no direct line connection between the husband and the wife what's
the end joins enjoins joins and end joins enjoins just
means second position joinery okay so the state joins with the husband
and joins with the wife there's no direct line between the husband and the
wife that is a broken line any architect or engineer will tell you that a broken
line on a blueprint is a beam that bears no weight and they put God on that
line so God bears no weight in the contract when you get married with the
state God bears no weight in the contract the state is the primary contract holder under the doctrine of
parents patre and if the husband wants to deal with the wife they have to go through
the state if the wife wants to deal with the husband they have to go through the state and so
on yeah yeah and they tell you you have to
get a divorce if you want to separate when you get a
divorce you're still under contract with the state so you still have to work through
the state even if you've been divorced 30 years you work with the
state they get involved in every aspect of your life between the two of you with
the state so I said this in one of my classes in
Alabama and it was a class of the 10th Amendment Society and the 10th Amendment Society
down there took this to their state legislatures and the state of Alabama no
longer issues marriage licenses wow they do what I tell them to do and
what I tell them to
do is to take a holy Bible a family Bible that has the pages in it and you
record the event the date the time the place who officiated couple of witnesses
and you do that with your births your marriages your deaths in your family and
you record them in a family Bible the state of Alabama says "Take these to a probate
judge and he'll record them on the land with the county
recorder and it's every bit as legal as that
but you don't have the state as a primary in your life that's how we supposed to get married
can you use anything besides the Bible
the Bible under public law oops
man 97
280 public law 97280 the Bible is law
the Bible is the word of God this nation was founded on God
principles and the Bible is law and since
16007 we the people have been recording our marriages our births and our deaths in the Bible and recording them on the
counties of this country since607 it wasn't until the 1930s that we
started doing this
any religious book you have freedom of religion
but this country was founded on Christian principles so as far as I know it's
any Christian Bible the Bible specifically the
1611 King James version was declared the word of of God
was by Congress made public law
okay it's the best I can answer that answer for
you but this is a problem
there's nothing no line between these two except through the state would we be
able to do that this way no you can do it in any state now
the church may not accept that to get a temple recommend they may require you
have a marriage license with the state of Utah see what see if they've been bastardized
okay it's not up to me isn't that just a
money generator though yeah well of course but it's more than that is to
keep your person's legal which is the undoing of
God's laws to keep control under the doctrine of parents
patre one P one P two Ps okay stay as your parent once we
understand these basic principles now you can move on and you can solve things
but until you know the basics you can't solve anything you just go around in this big old dumb circle
and get keep getting taxed your whole life taxed in one way or another whether it's a fine or go to jail whatever see I
started talking about indictments if you don't pay the bill you're brought up on charges if you
don't pay the charges you're asked to bond if you don't pay the bond your body is held assurityy for the bond while
they steal from your trust they take from your
sust number which is a CUSP number it's reg regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission you can look them up fidelity.com if if you know how to
navigate their website they make their website hard to navigate an easy one is GMEI utility gmai utility you can simply
go up to the upper right hand corner click on the little hourglass it brings
down a little search window and it says search for an LEI and you type in your birth
certificate number or your social security number or any of your CUSIP numbers or
LEI and it will show you the companies that are buying and selling you yeah
Jody pulled it up during lunch on her how many thousands of accounts did you have 15 some just under your social
security yeah so that's one cousup number of hers and she
hadund thousand plus companies buying and selling her
how much how much money did you have in there well will they show you how much money you have well they buy them in
groups bundles okay 10,000 25,000
100,000 okay let's just say they average $25,000 times a h
100,000 look how many zeros that is
okay you're worth millions and millions and millions of
dollars they have done a very good job investing hypothecating buying and
selling rolling those things over they bundle them they roll them over they hypothecate them and
151,000 yeah almost 152,000 companies buying her
United States Treasury bonds under her CUSP number
just for the and she can't even go buy a brand spanking new Lexus see you see
what I mean hundreds of millions of dollars in her account we did it on a dead person's social
security and they're still Oh yeah yeah my dad died in 1989 and I think last
year I think it was last year I pulled his social security up they're still buying and selling him they don't care
see they don't care it It lives on in perpetuity forever
to them we're all dead already right what difference does it make right
that's why they refer to us as cattle which is cattle and now now I think
we've degressed to sheep we've become
oid the United States code is a wonderful thing i keep telling the people that make the United States code
your friend because that's how we hold our public servants accountable it's not for them to use against us but they do
use it against US citizens because you're a one of them
they use against each other so if you're married another country with the same thing
well if it's a United Nations country how many people think we won World War II
no come on really how many people actually think we won World War II i guess it depends on what your definition
of win is but I'd say we did all right most people think we dropped a bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japanese
surrender we won World War II no just Japan surrendered
okay out of all of our enemies and all of our
allies we were the only country that was not a United Nations country
so the only way we ended the war was September 7th 1945 we signed the United
Nations Treaty which took effect 90 days later on December 7th
1945 which coincidentally Pearl Harbor was December 7th
1941 so we ended the war on technically on the same
day that it started but we signed the United Nations Treaty we gave him
Manhattan Island how do we know that well Rudy Giovani when he was uh mayor of New York
City the the press came to him and said "Can't we do something about all these guys with all these parking tickets down
there on Manhattan Island?" And he said "I don't have any control over Manhattan Island i'm just
the mayor of New York well isn't Manhattan right smack dab in the middle of New York City
yeah because it's United Nations owned it why do they We gave it to them in the
1945 treaty united Nations treaty we gave them 50 miles along the Mexican
border as well did you know that 50 miles wide those farmers down there that are right up against the border think
they own their own land they're sitting on United Nations property what about Alaska and Hawaii
that became states after December 7th 1945
if you look in our laws it says we have 47 states and Canada in our laws and
Canada we don't have Alaska Hawaii they're under the United Nations
you know what else we gave them part of our national parks we gave them
all of our police forces except our county sheriff's departments every city police force in
the United States is United Nations i built the I built the City of Ben
Police Department building and on the blueprints there were two locker rooms
each locker room had 115 lockers in them and a bench down the middle and all
these lockers and both rooms were
identical except this one had a vault door but
they were identical same lockers
forgive my artwork i'm not much of an
artist but when I built the City of Ben Police Department building I had to build two locker rooms and I said "How
come?" Well because this one's full filled with the duty uniforms and this
one's filled with their United Nations uniforms so when they have to switch over
if you look at uh State House Department publication
6227 written in 1961 it's an order from the United Nations to tell the police departments
to begin to find ways to confiscate our firearms a foreign nation has to work through our State Department
so all the police get instructed from the state department we found this out in Houston
Texas when the floods happened a few years ago and the Houston city of Houston Police Department had to put on
blue uniforms there's warehouses all over this country with the UN
vehicles ATEX assault vehicles in them all over
this country that the chief of police has access to
and so he can't touch it until the United Nations tells him he has to what
What is the legal definition of the word treaty it's a contractor agreement between two
foreign nations andor entities so if there is a
treaty they're foreign to us it's hard to get out of constitutions and treaties
okay have to create a new A executive order does not override a constitution
or a treaty you can't do the red line it'll override a statute but it won't
override a constitution or a treaty because you'd have to create a new contract or a new treaty
or revoke it can he do that i don't know not without an act of Congress and he doesn't have
Congress on his side congress controls the purse strings i I went to Melania and I said "Hey you
know we need some money to help fund the investigation of child and sex trafficking in the United States." And
she went to President Trump president Trump set aside $5 million to help
us that that went before Congress congress goes "$5 million what shall we
do with that let's create a a child and sex trafficking task force inside the
FBI and give the money to them they don't do anything
my job is to just really wake you up shake you and wake you really and your your your job
is to and not in a good way i I don't expect you to believe one single thing I say go research it find it out for
yourself if you want to or you can just take my word for it do what you need to do and move on and not spend 30 years of
your life researching okay so you can you make that decision
but what this takes me to is what we were talking about earlier about PTSD
okay every war prior to World War II was
authorized by Congress by our
government every war since World War II has been a United Nations authorized
conflict not a war declared by Congress
so as a moral young man joining the Navy the goal is to go serve your
country to protect the citizens to protect ultimately our families back
home and to fight a righteous war and we go to
war and we fight and we watch our buddies die and we get shot and bad things
happen and we come back home and PTSD is where our souls are in
conflict with our bodies that's all it is because we went
to war over money or oil not a righteous war not a war to
defend our country but a war over money or oil or
some other political
aspect and our souls know that our souls
know that even though we have the greatest of intentions and the most righteous
intentions we're out there committing murder and other
sins to fight a war that's
unrighteous and so we come back with PTSD and I call this fraud as I do most
things because fraud has no statute of limitations we were sold into believing
that it we were fighting for our country and we believed that with all of our
heart and all of our souls and we were
frauded and our souls know that our souls are energy that holds us
together and so our souls fight our bodies and we come back and we're having
problems and some veterans beat their wives or yell at their kids not because they want
to not because they don't love them but because there's something wrong with their mind they're in torment
and they do all manner of bad things including once every 22 hours commit
suicide and they come back and they go to psychologists and they get on drug
mindaltering drugs thinking it's going to help them and what they really need
to do is the nice thing about fraud is at
some point in
time that's the nice thing about fraud now let me explain that at some point in
time fraud must be recognized okay
the day it's recognized is the day the wheel falls off the wagon and everything comes to a halt and it viscates everything that
went before it it can't start moving again until it's recognized until it's satisfied
until it's settled as soon as I can tell veterans this
story now now they know why now they can recognize it now they can fall on their
knees and ask for forgiveness they can repent of sins they didn't
know and once they do most of them are forgiven and they stop having
PTSD and I've told this story at little BFW halls and band of brothers lodges
and things all over this country and I've had guys come back to me a month or two months later say "David I was in
therapy for seven years they had me on Zoloft and all kinds of different
drugs and the 20minut talk you gave me on this now my marriage is better i have a
better relationship with my kids i'm working again i'm back on track
thank you and it brings me into tears every time I even talk about
it but it's until this point in time where they recognize something of what
truly happened that they can finally wake up so this goes with everything in
our lives everything the government's doing to achieve power and wealth and
authority is fraud upon we the people
you ask me "Oh are you an anarchist?" No I believe in government i believe in
limited government our Constitution is one of the most
well-written documents in history so is the Declaration of
Independence we the people laid down the law in those documents and they step outside their scope and authority it's
their fault and it's up to us to hold them accountable okay the problem is
we've gone 150 or so years without holding them accountable for anything and when you don't hold somebody
accountable their rowdiness their authority grows and grows and
grows out of control and that's what's happened it's time to slap them back
down see the Constitution laid out 19 governmental
services We asked and set up our federal
government to provide us with 19 governmental services and no more and
the and no more is a pretty big deal 18 of them are clearly listed in
the constitution and one of them is in the preamble so there's 19 services that
we'd asked them to provide for us that we couldn't provide for ourselves and if they would provide them we could be
going about our ways and we could be farming and logging and catching fish
and doing our whatever it is we do build houses we could do whatever it is we
wanted to do we'd have freedom did we ask them to provide us
with 6,000 services and forces at gunpoint to pay for them no
you ask me why I don't want to pay taxes because I don't want to pay for the
5,980 services I didn't ask for that they don't have a right to
provide us with so how do I hold them accountable
part of it is by not paying taxes i'm not going to give them the money to do that the problem is they're
already taking it from me out of my cesv trust so unless I claim my minor estate
and take half of that money back my half according to the public
charitable trust where I'm the co-rustee and the co-beneficiary and the only signatory
officer if I don't stand up and take it back then they're just going to keep
using abusing us and that I am against see I'm against corrupt government i'm not against I'm
not anti-government i'm anti-corrupt government i want to stop the
corruption that's why President Trump signed an executive order calling on we the people for help he he first set up a
proclamation you know what a proclamation is it's a cry out
he wrote a proclamation asking we the people to volunteer to stand up and then he wrote
an executive order to support us and he asked us for help in his
proclamation of stopping corruption in the executive and the judicial
branch and a man named Chris Howlet stepped up to the plate a very good
friend of mine and Chris said "Hey I get it this
is loss prevention for the United States of America i've been in lo a loss prevention attorney all my life." He
used to work for Napa and other big corporations as an attorney who wrote
reports to show them how to save money loss prevention
and he said "That's all President Trump's asking us for it's a lost provision it's an emolements
thing." That's right article one section six clause 8 of the Constitution is a mullments violations we're paying them
to do a certain job and they're operating outside their scope and authority therefore it's a felony and
they're creating an emolement violation that we the people can hold them accountable for
and so when we see him doing that our job is to hold them accountable right so Chris set
up a company called E-Claus LLC he sends sent sent his report off to the president the president asked him to
speak in front of Congress congress gave him permission as a LLC to act like the
bar association he can go into court and he can watch out for
emolments okay and hold them accountable and we all can
chris made it so we all can how do we do that just work under
President Trump's executive order we can volunteer to do anything we want see I I got a nickname my little
group of the Pentagon Pedophile Task Force people call the Pentagon they go
"Hey you got a a pedophile task force?" And Pentagon said "What the hell?"
You know I didn't name it that we just worked under executive order doing what
the president tells us to do we gather the evidence and we turn it in to the Department of Defense and they take it
and run with it our job is just to gather and turn it
in under executive order so we do and then we got this stupid name and
then the pedophiles started hunting us and putting prices on our head and you know and they still do so what anyway at
some point in time this is where the wheel falls off the wagon is fraud fraud
can be challenged at any time there's no statute of limitations jurisdiction can be
challenged at any time there's no statute of limitations
this is a
key two things that can be challenged at any time you can be 20 years into a life
sentence challenge jurisdiction due to the fact of fraud and walk out of prison
there is everything's fraud there was no full anonymous disclosure of the birth certificate for one did you know a
vessel had been created in your name when you got a letter in the mail and it was addressed to your all caps names you
just think somebody made a spelling error you see what I mean
no they're sending a letter to your vessel they're calling the vessel they're summoning the vessel
are you saying that on your birth certificate what if it wasn't what if it wasn't so
it be valid it's always all caps on the birth certificate on the on the
certificate of live birth it's not always okay
okay they steal your soul they take your soul prints at birth they send you out to sea presumed
dead and lost at sea until you return and claim your minor estate
legal definition of the word minor is somebody under the age of 18 or somebody of any age who hasn't claimed their minor
estate we're all minors in this room over and over again the
Bible teaches you to take dominion of the jurisdictions land the air and the
water when you take dominion then you're above anyone trying to control you
you're sudjurist you're of your own rights your rights are unalenable therefore no one can control
you see it's why I can walk into any
courtroom let them know my status appear by special divine appearance show them I've taken dominion over my
jurisdictions and there's nothing for them to adjudicate it's that simple
as long as I don't murder somebody
okay so these are the issues well five 5G was
designed installed originally to cause a great deal of
harm and then it was recognized and President Trump came out
with Kofifi i knew you were gonna say that when he
tweeted out the word Kofifi everybody Yeah everybody thought he misspelled the word coffee
what's that yes it's a break it down it's a periodic
table table of the elements
yeah fe is iron so FEF is two two molecules of iron on
anyway so he had Motorola and Rayathon and a few other of our best companies
build a box it's about 18 in by 22 in and if you pull the circuit boards out
of them they actually say COVID 19 on the back of the circuit boards
it's a Kofifi box it's they have been going around installing them as fast as
they could on all the 5G towers uh trying to get them all installed before they were turned on they didn't get them
all installed they had to make millions of these things and what this box does is if you've got a 5G
tower lots of little things on it 5g are supposed to be the narrower ones yeah
they put a they they put the box on that creates a magnetic field that surrounds
the tower it turns the 60 hertz to 432
oops anyway to 432 what is 432
that's right because we're it created evil to righteousness here here's another thing
that people don't realize humans vibrate at one of three
frequencies celestial celestial and terrestrial three
frequencies let's tell you something you ever watch the show The
Jetson yeah you know about the white
hats go to Justin White on YouTube this is a military intelligence
channel on YouTube look up a video called The Last
Trump Technology it starts with Corinthians
1:25 that's a fun verse to read anyway kind of fun to look at you'll learn
things about the Shu Schuman residence and uh there's an island off the southeast
coast of Africa that our US Navy has been guarding for a very long
time and uh what what's taking place under that
island uh in Antarctica there's a pyramid
have you ever seen the pyramid i got pictures of it on my phone
um but there's some things under that pyramid thank thanks to the Japanese
they discovered part of it for us uh they they decided that they want they
like the best of everything the Japanese want the best of everything and
uh so they decided they wanted the best bottled
water so where would they go get that antarctica down at the bottom of
glaciers that haven't seen uh air in 70,000 years in Antarctica so they'd go
over there and they'd drill down with a 12-in drill bit and go all the way down to the bottom of these glaciers and
they'd pump steam down there and melt the lake and then they'd pump it out into these big ships and then they ship
them to Japan and then they'd bottle them bottle the water and they'd sell it for big bucks like $100 a bottle so
anyway they're drilling down with this 12-in drill bit and they hit what they thought was bedrock at the bottom of
this glacier and when they pulled the drill up and looked in the bottom of the drill
bit it had a piece of machined titanium with a high nickel
content wow and it drilled through a spaceship
70,000 years old and our US Navy found out about it
because we find out about everything and we went down there and opened the hole
up and went down and got a whole lot of technology out of a 70,000y old
spaceship you know I know we're getting off the subject here a little bit but there are all kinds of
technologies that could save us from many many different things
and it makes me mad that our Food and Drug Administration and other agencies of
government step on those things like you would not believe we've had cures for cancer for
years we've had all kinds of technologies scalar technology it's huge
got a doctor in Montana that can use scalar technology and if he knows the exact GPS coordinates of a guy that's
sick in Africa he can cure him from Montana using scalar scaler technology
be can be used for good or evil it can bring down an airplane it can freeze and
or microwave depending on if you positive or negative it depending on the
size of the unit that you use it could freeze an army in its
tracks turn them to ice or it could melt them in its tracks
or it could be used to cure malaria scalware technology could be
used for anything just and we've had it for a long time
since the late 60s russia had it first this is a wonderful
technology and they knew it could be used for good and they knew it could be used for evil i've got the CIA report on
it right here it's a wonderful thing i'm concerned about my grandkids going to school and
um the masks and if they don't comply
I'd be concerned too I'd be suing your damn governor right now
yeah I know how do we go about doing that oh there's already a lot of people doing
it and how do we get involved but everybody needs to get involved that
that document ought to have 25,000 signatures or 250,000 signatures okay
the lawsuit documents suing Herbert
anyway they're following a foreign agency okay the minute they do
that they shouldn't be get p being paid by us remove them from
office and imalment violation it's a constitutional violation i don't think
they put that in their lawsuit
you were going to ask me either i ought to ask him how to
spell
am I right
alls that means is this we the people lay down our laws
okay this country was founded on the law of nations by Battel a book written long
before there was a government on this short the law of nations by Vatel
what by Vatel he's the
author the law of nations we the people lay down the law when our public
servants step outside of the scope and authority of the law in which we lay down they are committing an emolement
violation in other words they're getting paid for their position of power and
using it in a method that we didn't authorize
okay that's what that means can you give an example oh my god
we asked them we asked them to provide us with 19 governmental services
they provide us with like 6,000
on and on and on and on and on okay we had a contract a a constitution is a
contract between we the people of the states forming a US government to
provide us with 19 essential governmental services that we agreed to pay for it's all it is
anyway United States Code we need to make it our
friend because that's how we can hold them accountable i can't say that often
enough if you don't know it you can't hold them accountable
the number one things the title 18 of the US code is
felonies that they commit on a regular consistent basis so title 18
USC sections 241 and 242
we need to know every one of us needs to know
those two if nothing else okay with those two we can get them
off of our back all
right 241 is a conspiracy to deprive us of our rights and 242 is a deprivation
of rights so if one officer deprivives us of our rights it
falls under 242 and if two or
more it's a conspiracy to deprise us of our rights anything that's a conspiracy
falls under RICO which is what Trump's trying to go after
huh trump trying to go after a lot of them all right now
if you look at our our uh sealed indictments which a
lot of them have already been unsealed the number one charges are
sedition and treason sedition and treason rico
racketeering okay when you're in a position like he is as governor
how many signatures on a ballot does it take to change anything
more than that see he's counting on you not being able to get that many people
together that's going to do it he can get up there and lie his ass off
say anything he wants and they do and if you can't get enough people together to fight me oh well you acquance
see government operates on the
unrebuttal of presumption
they presume they assume you don't rebut
you go out on your daily lives you watch your soap opers and you play your pickle ball and you know you don't do
anything and they do whatever they want that's how they take power that's also
what parasites do you know I was talking about you all
right so doesn't matter what you're doing but we should be able to live our lives ride
our bikes play pickle ball go fishing we should be able to do those things and
not have to spend every waking moment learning how to combat what they're
doing to us during this period of the great awakening and even before I've
been doing this about 35 years more than some of you have been alive
okay and during that time I have seen many many groups stand
up to fight and then those groups tend to go away over time because of
infighting amongst themselves they know that they know you're going to destroy
yourself that's why I tell people I love everybody that stands up i don't care how you fight i don't care what group
you're in i don't care if you're right or wrong as long as you're standing
because as long as you're making an effort to do so the people I don't like are the ones that don't make any effort
okay not everybody's going to be right no one's right 100% of the time or our
name would be Jesus Christ okay we're just
not i hope to be right as much as I
can but I'm not always right i try I try very hard try harder than most but I'm
not okay but as long as we're standing and making an effort they're not going
to get away with as much stuff they're like that bully little kid on the block that's whose parents never discipline
them and they just steal your lunch money and then pretty soon they're stealing your lunch box and then pretty
soon they're stealing your car and that's what they do they just do it a little at a time and they gain more and
more and more power and for the last 150 years we the people have not been good at standing up we just haven't the groups have been
too little and too small now we have thousands of groups out there we got the
jural assemblies we got patriot groups we got threeenters we got hundreds of
groups just standing up i refuse to be a part of any group
simply because I know that they self-destruct that you usually get
someone in who's a dictator type and it's my way or the highway and the other people are going "Well that ain't
right." We're talking about our freedom here we have freedom of expression we
should all learn we should all learn from each other and gather information and put it to work and I'm saying as an
individual as long as we take dominion over all three jurisdictions most of the
groups are jumping out of the water and onto the land with both feet and they say "This is where we want to be." And
then the water comes behind them and drowns their butts see because they didn't take
dominion over it they didn't jump into the jurisdiction of the air either and
that's the highest form of law why are they only going to the land when the
highest form of law is the air you're better off putting everything in a trust and jumping right in the into a trust
and holding the fidiciary responsibility you got more clout but they don't do that
either in fact some of those groups don't even believe in trusts in fact I was told by one of their leaders that
that was trusts were developed by the Catholic Church and I go "You got to be kidding me what's Genesis?" Was that
developed by the Catholic Church that was long before the Catholic Church all through the Bible is trusts trusts are
the highest form of law even judges know that they know a fidiciary is the
highest clout right huh
that's right so why aren't they jumping into that jurisdiction
right now right all they're thinking about is property
equity their rights that's all they're thinking about you can't have your rights until you take dominion over all
three this is what I'm trying to get through their heads once we do there's nothing to
adjudicate we've already settled the matter everything is a settled matter
the trick is to be at peace see I want to be at peace as long as I can until
I'm backed into a corner and then by God I'll fight but until then I'm at peace and
they're at war they they're bringing the summones and the war ends
right they're declaring war look at the Liber code we've been under the Liber
code since 1861 March 23rd I think can you declare war on a spirit though that's not alive
they're inland pirates they're after your vessel your ship
it's why the US Navy raised the high water mark in Colorado they put it up on the top of the mountain
in brass and stone there's a high water mark so everything under So everything's underwater
it's inland piracy you know what the highway robbers are doing with the blue lights on top their
cars they're highway robbers highway pirates yeah it's inland
piracy okay it's a all a matter of unlawful
conversion is they unlawfully convert our soul our name the things that are most precious
to us they convert them into something else that they can control and we just sit back and go "Oh
well shoot i got a letter in the mail today i guess I better answer it oh it
says I got to show up in court on May the 3 and 8:25 in the morning guess I
better go." and you show up under general appearance to your all caps vessel name
you don't know the difference you know they used to call it a straw man i hate that term i hate that term too because
it's not it's a vessel it's a separate entity and I hold the office of person
as a signatory officer for the vessel so I sign the bills of lighting i pay the bills of the
ship i take inventory of the cargo that's my job as a person as a
signatory officer but until I become the captain and take ownership of the ship and pilot
that sucker I'm just a person i'm just a
signator you got to take ownership of your vessel okay now once you've taken ownership now
you're the co-rustee co-beneficiary
till then you have no access to it you don't even know how to use it to pay off your
car or your house you know that one you don't own
that the state does how come you don't own your home
errors because of clerical errors this is a wonderful friend of
mine in Indiana this is the tax bill he got on his home in the mail i said "Make
me a bunch of copies of your tax bill." It was a one-page bill he made me a
bunch of copies i start off and I go "Huh?" top
left hand corner very first thing is an error it says a parcel number that's an
error so I circle the error and I bring a little line down and it says land
patent number 6743 and
6747 county correct the error
right go to the next page the next little box says property type real
estate come on real estate think about what that word is what its legal definition
is no it should say private property please correct the
error so I go to the next little box and it says name deed owner name
error it's under Dyson Doug i said Doug what's your name he
says it's Douglas Allen Dyson so I say name error douglas Allen
Dyson please correct the errors
said Dyson Doug well it just said deed owner's name deed owner deed owners a
warranty deed is an abstract of title and then it go to the next box it
says property address 3630 East State Road 14 Columbia
City Indiana 46725 now by writing it that way they
put it in the District of Columbia a federal district they took it off the map of Indiana and
they put it on a federal district map overlay okay a clear sheet of paper laid
over the map that they could make a whole bunch of errors on so I said "Wait a minute his address
is incorrect it is in care of 3630 East State Road 14 Columbia City Indiana
spelled out not in near in brackets
46725 non-domemestic without the United States
wow please correct the error which now put it at that location
now it says legal description united States code says all
property shall be held in meets and bounds should have a meets and bounds legal description what is that well from
this marker it's so many feet to this property corner and then it's so many feet to this corner and so many feet to
that corner and so many feet to that corner and so many feet back here and then this is the property it's in meets
and bounds they have it as lot 76 of stable acre
subdivision see they just made a clerical error they took the meats and bounds off they named it whatever the
SMU they wanted to name it you know what SMU is right the made
up okay and they made it whatever they
wanted to make it and they took off the lawful meets and bounds so I said error
see attached lawful meets and bounds land patent number 6743 and 6747 a part and parcel
thereof please correct the errors so then I went to the next error
and that's where all their money is you owe this much in penalty and fees and this much in delinquent tax and this
much in other assessments see table four and this much in property tax and on and
on and on and I circled and I said error land patent of private property is
taxexempt please correct the error land private property is tax of course it
is oh at the bottom of each of these it says exhibit A exhibit B exhibit C
exhibit the EFG so then it says check here for a
change of address so I put error boxes Chicago styles manual anything in a box
is not part of the contract and I circled all the boxes on the page and I
said please correct those errors okay then we post his property with the
land patent numbers we put up a sign that says no trespassing
$250,000 fine without appointment and not open to any federal
agents no jurisdiction and we post the property
then we record it for 90 days then we go record it with the county recorder's office and then guys like Ken Cromer can
move back in their house after they've been out of it for 10 months and it's been sold to somebody else yeah so how
did they rectify that guess who bought Ken's house his bishop
now his bishop has to sue the c the the court to get his money back
because he can't sue Canon get the house
okay the sheriff sold it to the sheriff sale on behalf of the Internal Revenue
Service and I'm sure the money was sent to them so we filled out some documents for
the Internal Revenue Service said "Show me where there was a verified audit show me where there was proper due
process." Oh wait they just shut up and write you a little letter back and said "Uh oh well we don't have any proof of
that you You don't owe us anything." See when you go down that
road often We don't fight with them at all we're at peace we just our job is
one of two things we only have two jobs in life one is to correct the errors our
public servants make and then to educate them so they don't do it again they're all compartmentalized legal idiots and
we have to understand that so that we're not beating them up because otherwise we'd be wanting to kick their ass right
imagine that you're correcting their errors oh it's a full-time job
it's a full-time job not what we should expect well for a while for 150 years
you've been laxed and so is your parents and grandparents so now we got to make up for that we got a lot of errors to
correct out there every property gets one of these in the mail and there everything on here was an
error by the time you go through this everything's circled so that's what I said they make an
administrative error by a compartmentalized legal
idiot and we don't correct so therefore we acquies most
people would just write him a check for $137.73 and
$1,254 and $2562 and say we paid our property taxes
because his his property is literally three lots right next to each other
how does one determine what their means and
records your your cgrapher uh your records go back in your deeds in order
to get your original land patent you have to do a title search and there may have been 20
owners but somebody clear back here
here somebody John Doe got the
original land patent from the United States government and then he granted it
to his ears through a grant deed see it can't be sold it can only be
granted it could be granted for consideration but it can't be
sold so you grant deed to his heirs right and maybe that's Bob
do and then he grants it to his somebody
grant deed and then they sell it and it's a warranty deed
at this point in time right here is where the county stole the property on behalf of the state and that may have
been six owners ago and the land patent was probably a
640 acre piece of property and you own this little lot
right here so this is land patent
number 2170 or something and you only own this but that's an underlying land
patent so this is why we say a part and parcel thereof so you get the meets and bounds
description of that as a part and parcel of land patent number
2170 and there's your property so
many things sure before he even had this
issue but see fraud at some point in time it must be recognized so he didn't
know this stuff he didn't know there was an underlying land patent he couldn't be kicked out or anything like that and the
sheriff came kicked him out he's out living on with somebody else for 10 months
and then some ugly guy named David came along and said "Hey why don't we just put your property back into this
original land patent and accept the last grant deed we have to accept that grant
deed and then record it and then publish it and then tell the court where to go
and how to get there." Okay David and move back in because otherwise
they'll get you on abandonment laws so we moved back in and I had to fly back to Oregon so Shauna Cox and Ryan Bundy
came up and stayed with Ken the first three nights they were out barbecuing on the backyard and the police showed up
bad move on their part because he Ken says "Well why don't you guys just call
the county recorder's office and see whose name's on the deed?" And they did and so they left
okay so does he get a tax bill every year
if he gets one this next year he's going to do that because they're going to keep
trying they don't give up for a while once you beat them three or four times it's not worth their time and effort
they'll just cost us more than that thousand dollars to fight you we're going to
quit you have to do a title trace back to the original land patent
all the way back you get the land patent and I would get at least four certified
copies of the underlying land patent from the Bureau of Land Management's office they Bureau of Land Management
took over the US land office they they hold all the patents you have
to do a title trace and then do what well you got to do a chain of title
trace so that you could find the last grant deed because it might have been sold 40 times right so you got a
warranty deed a warranty deed a warranty deed a warranty deed and then maybe a grant deed back here you got to find
that last grant deed and you got to trace it back to find the land patent
then you can go to the cgraphers's office and also maybe find the land patent and you might have to go to the
BLM office find it but when you do your research and you find the land patent then you do a part and parcel thereof
according to the meets and bounds of description and you accept the last grant deed and then you post your
property for so many days and then you record it
and there you go do they have a right to own that land or
is it our right to own we own it they manage it you put a patent on land no
no if there was an underlying land patent that means it was once homesteaded then you can file on that
homestead so would you have to buy it then or you can just move in and paint it as yours
well I know people that have done it both ways
she asked if you have to buy it then or if you can just move on and claim it and I know people that have done it both
ways but you got to fight for what's yours you got to educate your public servants if they
come after you and it's usually not that hard condos you can't it has to be a
prim it's supposed to be a primary residence
however if you don't have long-term renters all you got to do is camp there for 10
days see the trick the trick on foreclosure foreclosure is they get you
by abandonment laws sheriff comes puts all your stuff on the curb and kicks you
out of the house locks the door and then you leave and you don't come back claim your
property i know a guy that came back moved back into his house day
after about 30 days later the sheriff comes back what are you doing here i'm going to throw you in jail
throw him in jail for one night guy gets out of jail he goes back home moves
in he's there for about another 30 days sheriff says "I'm going to throw you in jail for a week." Throws him in jail for
a week sheriff can't hold him much longer than that it depends on your state laws how long in Utah is a
contempt charge 30 days 30 days in Utah so they can hold you 29 days and then
they have to give you a hearing okay but then what happens move back
in how many times can they hold you for contempt three times you can spend 90
days with a three hots in the cot three contempt charges just keep
moving back in and pretty soon they can't kick you out of your house anymore people don't know that i got a
good friend in Australia who beats the Australian courts all the time and he says
this never give them your last name they say your
name no no your honor my name is this
they never he says never give them your last name because it puts you in a
military jurisdiction okay and and they typically
do it under all caps
first like that and then David Lester
okay so a military ID is also a cusup number by the way you were bonded again
and you were insured again in fact since they have a good bet that you might get
killed in the military they insure you for more yeah really oh yeah just recently went
from 5 million to 10 million on your
life see if you were born after 1975 you were bonded for a million
and insured for
two between 1933 and just a few years ago during the Obama administration when
you joined the military you were bonded for 2 million and insured for
five and they raised it to 10 so who clicks on that insurance
goes into your cesa QV trust and then any money earned on that for in
perpetuity it also pays back the loans guarantees the loans of the IMF the
initial that was in bought and invested
in think of it as FDIC insurance at the birth that's what it is essentially
so this is kind of funny if the IMF is the lender the
IMF lends the million dollars to the public charitable trust they just
put it out there in the public right then they insure they bond you for
a million and they insure you for
two that's a guarantee that they get paid back in case you die of uh what is
it called when little babies die a few days later sids sids in case you die of
SIDS so what what is this
this is fiat what is this
that's real money oh really
so what what if you get a paycheck stub who who works for a living gets a paycheck stub not many hands around here
nobody works for a living okay you get a paycheck stub you take your
paycheck into your bank right on the back of your check there's a line says to endorse here
right if you sign your
signatory and you write USC 12 section
411 then in their computer they have to convert it to real money so they change
the dollar sign you're cheating me no when you open a
bank account when you sign your signature card if you write USC 412411
on your on your signature card everything that goes into your bank and out of your bank is real money and it
discharges your debt
yeah see United States code is our friend and you don't know it how does that work with direct
well that's why it has to be on your signature card when you open your account you're g you're telling them to
deal in real money instead of computer see this is legal
tender gosh I can't even write here legal tender
tender it tenders it to a later date never discharges the debt real money
discharges
debt alls they're doing is hitting a different dollar key on their computer
they have to keep track of both was it USD 1211
title 12 section 411 okay you have to do it through your signature card at your
bank when you open your account all money shall be converted to real money
it's just a computer thing so So I should do that with my personal account can I go back with my personal
then you had you educate your public servants they're compartmentalized legal idiots see you got to learn it and then you got
to educate them and control them it's up to you to hold them accountable any public servant must be
taxed pay income tax private individuals do not owe a tax
on their wages their sweat of their brow
okay W4 you don't fill out a W4 when you go to
HR okay the first thing you do is you fill out a form 56 which notifies the IRS of what your
status is a form 56 tells them who you are
then at your employer you fill out a W 8
BN as a tax exempt foreign estate and or
trust now they can't withhold any taxes from you now you can't do that because you
work for the federal government neither can you you need to change your status
first anyway status is everything in the law status standing then jurisdiction so
you change your status then you take dominion over your jurisdictions and then you have standing you don't have
standing until you take dominion that's why they say all are equal in the law
rich or poor black or white ignorance of the law is no excuse you all have the same standing you're
all just as dead as the dead deer on the side of the road you all are equal to that deer you can't
stand up and walk away you're all dead that's what being a citizen of person or
resident is you have to change your status do and claim your minor estate
your children are part of your minor state until they reach age and then they
have to do it for themselves or just maintain that they are still see they
self-determinate the problem the difference between them and you is you've gone about your whole life
marking boxes saying you're a US citizen filling out W4s and and
and paying your taxes with 1040s and doing all these things claiming to be a
US citizen now you got to correct the errors you've been making they haven't made those errors yet if they're still
young okay so they don't literally have to do anything except make a declaration
reclaim their title file it with the county yes i mean
status status is always the first step we have to correct that error that we've
been making that's what this is to help well that that's just kind of steps to freedom i mean you have to kind of get
that done to correct the errors you've been making your whole life but this is the beginning of changing the status
right yeah well yeah the first part is changing the status and then when we change our status we need to write an
affidavit and communicate that right because in in the United States code in
Title 8 section 1101 is our definitions of status the federal government says "Here it is here's all the statuses that
we accept your job self-determination pick one notify them
in writing via an affidavit under the penalty of perjury of what you are so
you're telling them what you are you're making that determination okay so you notify them via affidavit all they have
to do is have it on file they're not going to answer your affidavit so what do you do with it you make it a court of
record now here's a part I want you guys pay close attention to
what is a court of
record soon
i'm
waiting recorded record is just a
record hold
an article 3 or an article six court is automatically a court of record they're
a constitutional court of record
six
okay but what I'm talking about is not a brick building somewhere okay the brick
building is not a court of record none of these courts are courts of record in
fact in one case here in Utah we proved that uh the first district court of Cash
County along with seven other county courts in this state are owned by one
man who lives in Ogden and his headquarters are in Ogden Utah not even in Cash County and he owns them just
like a McDonald's franchise so do you think they're government
yeah that's what I'm talking about he's got a He's got a Dun and Bradstry number you look him up on
mana.com it says private for-profit
corporation yet everybody everybody gets charged of any kind of crime in Cash County goes to the first district court
of Cash County he owns the court does that mean he
hires his own judges does that mean he hires his own attorneys
does that mean he gets a cut off what you what fines you pay
do we know his name yes we do would you say it no
so what is a court of record
yeah you picked up on that huh thought I said that quickly yes you want to look
everything up on Dun and Bradstreet and mant.com get their Dun and Brad Street numbers i was going to talk about this
tomorrow manta.com
yeah you're getting ahead of me you guys okay this was tomorrow i was going to
talk about knowing thy enemy okay all right
your documents become a court of
record when they are properly served
publicly
published and
filed your documents become a court of record when they're properly served
publicly published and filed so what does that mean okay let's
just say we're changing our status you write an affidavit you send it to the Secretary of State of the United States
Mike Pompeo that's who you're required to send it to by the United States Code now
me I want everybody to know about it so I sent it to Donald Trump i sent it to our attorney general William Bar i sent
it to Mike Pompeo i sent it to the Secretary of State of the State I was born and I send it to the Secretary of
State in the state I choose to inhabit and they all get one and every time there's a regime change I send it
again i want them all to know why I made that decision
okay so I send my affidavit to Mike
Pompeo and I send it registered mail return receipt required so I get the
green card back that somebody has to sign for and it tells a date on when they
received it i get that back one to two weeks
later does somebody there sign for it and I always send it notice to agent is
notice to principal notice to principal is notice to agent okay so it doesn't matter who signs for it it's just like
he grabbed it himself out of the mailman's hands he's been served so then
I do a
certified proof of
service certified proof of service attaching that green card to a
document that I attach to my copy of the affidavit so you do a certified proof of
service page and you attach it to your affidavit one to two weeks when you get
it back what I do is I've got a speciallymade page and I set the green
card on it and I run a little bead of superlue right along that top edge and I'm bind it to that
document okay now I have to wait from the date that's
on here that he received it i have to wait 21 days for his
response so on the 22nd day of his response I do a
certified
judgment of unrebuted
affidavit a certified judgment of unrebuted affidavit he didn't respond he
acquanced they know that they don't care the affidavit becomes a judgment if they don't respond so I do a certified
judgment on unrebuted affidavit and I lay that on top of my proof of service
sheet which is on top of my document and now I go down to the county recorder and
I put it on the land and I publicly publish it i make it available to the public anybody can read
it and then if I ever need to first I take it home and I file it but if I ever
need to I pull it out of my home file cabinet and I file it in a court case along with my notice of
appearance where I'm telling them what my status is that becomes an
exhibit see it becomes an exhibit to my notice of appearance
so I have proof of my status now you can also take that
document and you can go get your passport so from Utah you either got to
go to Denver San Francisco or Seattle to get your
passport from Oregon I got to go to Sac uh you got to physically go there san
Francisco or Seattle i take people up there all the time to get their
passports okay because we get it as a state national so how do you do that
you look on your steps page that you were handed you download the DS11 form on
your computer so and print it out then you go to Copper Moonshine Stills and you fill it out exactly the way he tells
you to fill it out he's been helping people for 20 plus years and he keeps up
to date i trust him so fill it out that way then you take that go to Costco or
wherever get your two photos and your ID that's required your
pieces of ID and you have it filled out so that it's filled out the way a state
national supposed to fill it out take your two pictures take your ID
that's required take your affidavit with you go to the agent who's going to issue
you your passport and you say this and nothing but
this here's my application properly filled out here's my two photographs and
here's my picture my IDs that's required and here is my affidavit that determines
my status under title 8 section 1101 A21 and 23 that I am a state national
recognized by the United States of America as a as a clean and proper status as one of we the people please
issue me a passport that reflects that status and then you shut
up and he's gonna go get his supervisor okay and the supervisor comes
out you say "Well I submitted my application properly filled out my two
photographs and my ID is required and my affidavit of status that determines my
status as a state national accepted by the United States of America please
issue me a passport that reflects that has status and then you shut up
and he'll go back and he'll say come back at 3:30 and pick it up
and you come back at 3:30 and you pick up your passport can I use my proper passport as my ID
your popper passport yes you can ask for is well it's what it used to be
every Secretary of State makes up his own policy
so for a while the P was popper then in a while the P was person and
then who knows what they peed on next it doesn't really matter when they scan the
barcode that's what matters the passports are going to look like any other passports but when they scan the
barcodes if I scan it in a police mine in a police car it'll say do not stop do not detain
what I'm telling you is we've been making a lot of mistakes we got to correct those errors and move on
yes you do if you go the post office is just a transfer station and it's like
the old telephone game you remember that if I say something into a telephone to
you and then you tell them and then you tell them by the time it gets back around it's a totally different story
well when you go to the post office and try and explain this there's no way in heck they can explain it to Denver which
is where they send it see all they're doing is transferring it
gosh if you lived in Texas you could go to either Dallas or Houston
yeah but from Utah you got to go to Denver Seattle or San Francisco and your
your documents become the court of record when always remember this
see if you go to court and you just submit your documents into a court case
administratively that judge can do whatever he wants with them he can throw them out but if they're publicly published
and then submitted in court it's a settled matter he there's nothing for him to adjudicate he can't destroy a
document or under the United States Code he's committed a felony you want to start holding these
judges accountable publish your documents first then submit
them in your court case then if he throws them out he's in deep doodoo now
you counter sue every state statute in the United States says
this every state statute says this the only remedy in a state court is a tort
claim did you hear what I just said if you're just playing defense you can't
win a football game you got to go play defense and offense and you got to do it
at the same time so if you want to win you sue
them it's a tort claim if I go out here on the street and I come to a stop sign
and somebody runs into me what do I do i want you to think
about this for a second i go to the person i gather his insurance information what company do you have
what's your agent what's his phone number what's your policy number i don't care that much about you accidents
happen but now I go file a claim with the insurance
company and they pay the bill what does government teach you to
do to go complain go complain file a
complaint i think part of that's ain't nobody want to hear you complain
nobody cares if you complain if you do complain and they inve decide to investigate it who's going to
investigate it the people you're complaining about it don't mean nothing
never complain about anything it's not worth your time or day didn't your mama teach you that stop
complaining quit whining stop complaining my mom used to say that all the time quit complaining she was
telling me complaints don't matter she don't want to hear it she's
not going to listen neither are they but the government's really quick to hand you a complaint form then they can round
file it the minute you walk out the door and you drive out of the parking lot they don't
care you file a claim i David Lester Strait claim Bob
Jones trespassed against me he committed this felony and this felony and this
felony they carry a penalty of $250,000 and one to 10 years in
prison now I sign it and notoriize it and I put it into a court
crap crap that's what they're saying this guy
actually filed a claim and then I go "Oh and here's a foyer request i want to know who your
risk management company is ah see up in Montana there were a couple
of people in a county who were getting beat up by the county sheriff for exercising their constitutional rights
and the sheriffs were putting them in the hospital so we went after Mako the
Montana Association of County Insurance whatever it is i don't
know what it is mako it's the insurance company we sued the insurance company for the amount of their policy writer we
found out they were insured for five million so we sued them for
4,995,995 bucks because they have a constitutional
writer and they had constitutional rights as your sheriff was taken away from them and
Mako settles a claim out of court writes a check for
[Music] $4,995,995.95 and then Mako goes to the sheriff says "You ever do that again
we're dropping your insurance policy you better knock that off." And you know what people are treated a whole lot
better in that county now so you don't
sue Bob Smith you sue his put in a claim to his insurance company who are these
guys under their oath who are they bonded by what insurance company do they
have every one of these municipalities are bonded and insured
you know the uh Supreme Court of the State of Arizona has a $3.5 million liability
policy and they're behind on their payments 120 days i know that because we sued the
Supreme Court of the state of Arizona utah Department of Transportation has a Dun and Brad Street number and is a
private for-profit corporation now the departments of transportation are actually very very powerful everything
in this country is about transportation and shipping of goods and
services okay so you'll learn some very valuable lessons about the department of
transportation they're required to issue you a regulation Z plate and most of
them don't even know what one is in fact in Oregon on the Oregon's website when
you type in regulation Z plate it says you can get them here here and here
regulation hold on a minute get Don't get ahead of me it says you can get them here here
and here so I called here talked to a gal that had been there 35 years she'd never heard of one never sold one never
nobody had ever asked for one so I went to the next one and this guy was some
warehouse somewhere for the Department of Transportation he goes "Oh man I I
think we have some lying around here i think I saw a box of them once maybe 20 25 years
ago i'll see if I can find them." I said "How long would it take?" He says "I don't know give me the rest of the
afternoon i'll call you tomorrow." Called him tomorrow i couldn't find them couldn't find them
anywhere no I asked everybody nobody knows where they are so I called the next one they go "Ah this is the place
that actually makes the plates i think we have a machine that makes it we might even have some of the
metal that makes them i can't find any on the shelves but the machine sitting in the back corner i'll go see if we can run it."
They didn't even know how to fire it up they hadn't sold one in 35 years
nobody in Oregon had asked for a regulation Z plate in over 35 years
remember when I told you at the beginning all things are banking in this country regulation Z under the banking
laws say they must provide you with a republic form of government under
regulation Z so to travel freely upon the roadways they're supposed to be able
to issue you a regulation Z plate to put on your car it never has to be renewed and it's your right to travel but these
state DMVs don't even know what the hell they are nobody's asked them for one in 30 or 40
years because they're getting all the fees and all the stuff
that's what I asked you when you pay cash for your truck and then you said you're going to take it to a foreign you
know country well then I once I've got the MSO in my hand I don't have to do anything they can't tell me what you
have no I don't i could fly the civil flag a piece on the front of my truck i
don't need I don't need a plate if I as long as I own it you only need to play because the state owns it the state has
your MSO
you can't do it on a used car either because the state has it somewhere unless under the salvage maritime laws
manufacturer statement of origin go listen go have fun go hold
your public service accountable it really does get to be fun by the way
once you know what I'm teaching you here and you know how to how to solve these
issues man they're they're just going "Oh crap." Because all they are really
is paper pushers oh yeah uh Ron U Ken
Chromemer's bishop tried to get the federal court involved federal court looked at the land patent and said
"Sorry not even the federal government can overwrite a land patent a president of the United States
signed a land patent to his successors and/or assigns
forever no one no one can override that superior title
now they can only take it for needful things like a freeway
anyway but then they have to pay fair market value for it so not just kick you out for
foreclosure have you ever heard of the coffee bean case okay this guy got sued the judge
ruled against him before the judge was ready to throw the hammer down he says
"Judge do you care how I pay this?" It was like
$1,140 or something do you care how I pay the
$1,140 judge says "No I don't care so I could pay it in coffee
beans." And Judge says "I don't care how you pay it." Throws the hammer down guy
goes home he counts out 1141 coffee beans puts them in a bag circles the
transcript of the court transcript where the judge says "I don't care how you pay it you can pay a coffee beans." He goes
in the court clerk and he gets a receipt paid in
full because the 1141 coffee beans were worth more than the paper fiat currency
it was actually a commodity could have been in toilet paper
okay it was not so long ago huh
and that's an actual case on the books okay you can have fun with this stuff
once you learn that's my area of expertise
okay as far as debt goes though let me answer his question
first try to avoid debt at all costs is what I'm going to tell you save your
money then go buy some do without for a little while then go buy some stay out
of debt all you can now obviously if you're going to buy a house you're not going to save up $200 or $300,000 or
whatever it is to go buy a house you have to go into debt to buy a house you probably have to go into debt to buy a
car okay i don't recommend it i recommend saving up $1,000 buying a $1,000
car and then keep saving money until you get what you want okay stay out of debt
if you can stay out of debt that's my advice if you can't stay out of debt
learn how to establish your status standing in jurisdiction then learn how to purchase things and pay your debt off
with your birth certificate trust
we we we can do that
yes but it's kind of hit or miss right now and that's the problem because like I said you never know who's on the
receiving end what does the Bible talk about warning us
about ball what is barium ba
What is aluminum
al periodic table of the elements is ball i owned a hydroponic manufacturing
company we build all of our hydroponics out of aluminum had companies calling us saying "Hey can we buy all your scrap
aluminum?" Yeah sure where where do you want it shipped to oh we want to ship to
the airport in Portland what are you going to be doing with it oh we grind it
into powder we spray it back on you i said "No I'm not selling it to
you." Barry and aluminum ball it's talked about in the Bible
dcfs okay the first thing they do when they come to your house is they want to come in and see it well you're just
opening the door and letting them in that is consent they're a private for-profit
corporation you don't know your enemy you think they're government they might even show up with
a police a policy enforcement agent they wrote their own
policy i was just I'm working on a case out of Florida for a church the FDA is
coming after him pull up an article i found out the FDA has
1892 policies that were created by just an
employee she can't create policy somebody appointed to the
position by Congress or the president can create policy an employee can't
that's 1890 policies that this woman created over a 30-year
period that they're treating as law and she had no authority to create
those policies every agent of our government does
that dcfs the what set up that agency you
have to know your enemy know who they are what set up that agency title
four social security title
four and ASPA create the these two things created
that agency DCFS or CPS or whatever your state wants
to call it what's asthma yeah let's just call it child protective services
every state calls it something different aspa American Safe Families
Act these two acts of Congress created th that agency in both acts of Congress
it says that they cannot take a child away from a
parent unless the parent gave their
consent or the parent has been tried and found guilty by proper due process of
law of a felony and if they take a child from a
parent they must search for a relative to place it with first and then if no
relative steps up to the plate they can adopted out to a foster home
so both things that set up that agency this is how they get paid by the way
it's title four
says they can't take your child yet they do based on your consent
the minute you let them in the door the minute you sign a family plan they do it
off of accusations that could have been a neighbor called them and said your kid
was out in the sun too long well here's the reason cps is a private
forprofit agency every child is worth and this is going
to kill
you every child is worth 3.3 million they pull
1.5 million from the father's cestv trust
they pull 1.5 million from the mother's saqv
trust they get $300,000 at between 8 and
16,000 per month from title 4
D and E funds
if they adopt them out the United States government pays them a $40,000 bonus
now here's the part that makes me just want to grab arms and
go is that the CPS agent themselves depending on how many ch
children per month they remove they get bonuses
they get bonuses
you can't even believe how mad that makes me
is that why kids are moved through the child protective services system out of the 800,000 children trafficked a year
in the United States 86% come through those agencies the
balance are just taken off the street
86% how can they just disappear you want me to tell you okay I'll tell
you all right their policies state this first of all they take your
kid let's just say you had an accusation they show up with a cop they
take your kid they have you sign a family plan that family plan says you'll do this and you'll do this and you'll do
this it could be drug testing psychological evaluations bond whatever
okay all these services that they will provide every time they get you to do a
service they get to bill Title
4 for those services they spend 18 to 24 months making you do
services telling you that if you do these services you'll get your kid back
their goal it is not in their financial best interest to return your child to you telling you right now you
know how many parents I get phone calls from that I did say they did everything they were told to do that they went
above and beyond that they did 110% and they don't know why they're not giving their kid back and last week they
terminated my parental rights what do I
do you don't comply that's what you do they terminate your parental
rights and then they move that child through the guardian at lightam usually
there's one and I hate to say this but there's one pretty female attorney in
her late 40s i don't know why this is but I've
investigated child and sex trafficking for many years all over this country i
can name names of pretty female attorneys in their 40s who
are like the priestess who facilitates the
trafficking and they always are a guardian at lightam and they move them from one
foster care to another and pretty soon they're deleted out of their system
and they don't never end up in the next foster care and they're gone my jobs here today is to piss you
off really because if you I don't piss people off they won't get up off their couch and do anything about it you have
to understand the process and then you have to go after them on attack you have
to go on the offense as long as you're playing defense and you're jumping through their hoops you're never going
to get that kid back when you finally say you're at your wit's end this is why
they do this this is why they string you out so long make you jump through these
hoops they want you to give up as soon as
possible i cannot even believe my country is stooped this low you know
what the turnover rate in child protective services is for an employee i had the head person from CPS out of
Arizona call me on the phone said "David you know what you're doing to us i
cannot hire people fast enough we're training 16 CPS workers a day in Arizona
because they're all quitting because of you." We took them from 40,000 children a year
to 700 7,700 a year being trafficked in Arizona
and I just got the figures for last month it was 577 kids went missing in the system now
this isn't what was taken system this went missing in the system last month
they don't know where they are in a month i cried when I got that yesterday
but I get those reports from all the states and that was just Arizona pizza gate in
2016 and all the media shut it down and then we've got now Epstein Island
well I know Q is You know what Q is most people don't see there's Q's and there's
Qons y Q anons are trying to figure out the Q
codes they're doing a good job of being a news media q tells the news and they
interpret and try and get it out there they don't always get it right but we
love them q is led by the president of the United States and it's all our groups of
military intelligence with the DoD it's also another agency as well
virginia well that's where all the military intelligence are pretty much i was told
and yes out of Virginia I was told most of the QNS don't even know who Q is Q is
a group of people if you took a circle and you built the
Great Wall of China right down through the middle of it you could write the name of every organization on earth in
that circle you could write the military any branch of it you could write the DoD
itself you could write the White House the administrative branch the judicial branch you could
write the CIA in there you could write the Mormon church the Catholic Church the Protestant church the Baptist church
you could write any organization on earth in there you could write Google and Apple and and Verizon
no they're they're over here all but what I'm saying yeah there's black hats
and white hats there's good and bad there's righteousness and evil okay all
right now in saying
that in this whole child trafficking stuff I turning in evidence
to General Valerie and then Millie and others i work with Special Operations
Command i work with Coronado um and turning in this evidence and then
I wow some stuff I'm turning in gets dealt with and some stuff it's like I
throw it into a trash can or into the black hole so we had to figure out which side
of the fence they were on am I handing the information to the bad guys yeah I
was for a while some of it was getting handed to the bad
guys because sometimes you when you walk through the door you don't always know who's going to come see
you now we're more careful about that you can't serve two
masters what is legal is not lawful and they represent what's legal that's
unjust it's unrighteous it's the undoing of God's laws how can they serve two masters how
can they undo God's laws and propose to follow God's
laws they can't do
both william Bar wants to tear up his bar card william Bar wants to bring down
the bar he wants to get back to the rule of law that's what he
wants okay he wants to be the one to bring the bar down
i hope he does it and I hope he does it soon because literally that's who we the
people have been at war with for a long time because of Justin's story they
control everything every corporation they control it all every form you fill
out implicates you this is why I don't like government forms i try not to fill out
any government forms sometimes I'll take the government forms off the court's website and I'll make them into my own
and I'll take out all the boxes and all the lines and all and I'll just make it into my own then I submit it and guess
what they take it but attorneys write things to remove
the liability from whoever they're writing it for and place it upon whoever signed
it okay now that's the main reason they don't
bring child protective services down it is a huge income producer $3.3 million
per child 800,000 children a year that's just the ones that are
trafficked everything evil mirrors everything that's righteousness so
whatever they're committing the evil or doing they try and mirror that back upon
the innocent so it's not them it's you doing it
i know I know of two police officers right here in Utah that are sitting in
jail for molesting their own children and they didn't molest their children i guarantee they are innocent and didn't
do it but because they ran into a satanic cult and they started bringing
it out and turning it in to the wrong people they got charged and they're in
jail right now and they were just young cops who didn't know any better all they did when the time they were little was
wanted to grow up and serve and protect the people and then they got into it and
found out how evil it truly was and then they started speaking out about it and
then they were persecuted they persecute the righteous let's look at some current events look
at uh uh Beirut Lebanon right okay what happened there does anybody
know exactly what happened there in Lebanon in Beirut
no no it wasn't okay tell us tell us but you're close so I knew something okay
people think What did they report what did the news report
fireworks plant caught on fire too close to a fertilizer storage plant well no
they had 25 2700 tons of ammonium nitrate all right that's what That's
what they claim okay the meter's really deep on that one what happened
is what happened is this
evergreen's a shipping company hillary Rodm Clinton
see when we remove the politics the right the left and we start to look at the evil George Bush is evil hillary
Rodney Clinton's evil Obama's evil you start to really recognize that these are
big corporations doing some very very very evil stuff
i'm not going to write the name down here these are three cargo container companies that we've identified as child
trafficking companies hill one is owned by Hillary Rodham Clinton's
foundation one is owned by Paul Pelosi NY's husband
okay so we went into Pier
45 in San Francisco we burn it to the ground when was this couple months ago
okay in Beirut in Hong
Kong at the uh the fires in Brussels at the World
Trade Center several other big major fires that have happened in the last couple of
weeks we've been taking out Evergreen all over the world
nice in Beirut evergreen
cargo container company shipping containers okay we've been taking Evergreen out all
over the world so in in Beirut since we trained MSAD Israeli
military industries we sent them into the tunnels to rescue all the children under
under about two and a half square block area they even had an underground
hospital underground dormatory underground everything lots of children under
there and we sent them in and they came out and they lit the place on fire and
that's why you saw smoke long before the missiles hit it was on fire it's pretty
hard to burn down concrete and steel
it's real hard to burn it so anyway they spread some stuff around in there and
they lit it on fire to cause a smoke screen because if you remember how that
sat you had that kind of island and you had three
buildings like this and then you had a big glass building like this and most of town is
over here this building was designed to stop the blast right
what's that are they silos green silos no these are these are concrete they're
structures structures okay they're filled with evergreen shipping containers and underneath is child
trafficking tunnels all over underneath they'll lead clear into the city mainly
led into this building so that trucks can back up over here and pick them up
okay so they went in there they rescued the
kids they set the building on fire
and then our military estimates
engineering depending on the width of the concrete wall how much steel reinforcement rebar they think is inside
the wall how many shipping containers around the outside out of the wall they try and estimate what size bomb to throw
in there to take that out they don't care
if this building hits they're trafficking them out of that building too so they didn't care if that one blew
up either but this is what they were after so they estimated what size
bomb and they happen to in this case use a Moab
a mother of all bombs and it flew
well in between the time intelligence went in and located the kids and planned
the mission and the mission took place some containers had been moved couple other things they underestimated is the
construction quality of those buildings over in the Middle East not always is a building built up to our standards so it
had a little less rebar a little wider spaced a little more porous concrete and so when that bomb went in it blew a
little bit harder than they expected it to nevertheless it did its job and it
left a crater that opened up the tunnels and then people could the news media
could look down in there and go "Ha there's a whole bunch of tunnels." Now they crawl under the tunnels they find
the dormitories they find the medical facilities they find all this stuff and they'll know exactly why so the object
of the game is this it's to not only destroy it but it's to expose it right
but the news isn't exposing that's why President Trump fights the
news all the time is does not a does not
a single day go by that he isn't calling them fake news
exactly they're never going to report the truth there's other organizations now we have ON and we have Twitter I
like Twitter for the news that's where I go because it comes right out of the horse's mouth yes I want to know exactly
what the president says what our top generals are saying and what William Bar is saying and what Mike Pompeo is saying
and I want to know exactly what they're saying right out of their own mouth so I followed them on Twitter and guess what
i cut out the middlemen known as CNN and others and I just cut them out of the
picture by listening to the horse talk this is the United States of America
believe it or not no I have no idea how to draw but it doesn't matter what I'm
going to tell you is this we know where all the rat lines are and
where they go what is a rat line
it's a trafficking line what is it a rat
this one actually splits a rat line
up the east coast and up the Hudson River
there's a there's actually five main trafficking lines this one kind of got
goes uh mainly actually from Louisiana Alabama so for like that right in here
there's another one that goes up there's five trafficking
lines in the United States rat lines what if I was to tell you something like
this i wasn't going to do this till Sunday but what if I was to tell you
that there is an attorney who has an office in Pakip New
York and an office in Belleview Washington same
attorney and he's partnered with an attorney out of Belleview and an attorney out of
here and what if I told you that out of this office he created over a hundred
corporations to traffic children i'm talking
about entertainment companies that take
pictures lodging companies short and long distance trucking
companies even an airline that's stationed at Boeing
offering companies you have to have all elements of trafficking so you have to have
transportation logistics offerings okay 5x5
entertainment wild child entertainment corporations like that
he's set up what if I told you he set them up under mostly aliases names but we have
the real names too what if I told you you set them up for people who are police officers county commissioners
and judges i'd believe it okay I read cover up now what if I told you the same
attorney in the state of New York owns 17 child protective services
agencies in the state of New York and he also owns 17 family courts
he owns the Spafford Center which traffics children to Jerusalem and the
United Kingdom what if I told you I had pictures of two American boys with a
Hezbollah boy over in Jerusalem carrying AK-47s and one's seven and one's 11 and
I know where family they came from here in America
what if I told you in 1983 he bought a company from William Casey's law firm
the DoD guy is going to start scribbling here when I mention names i'm serious william Casey who was William Casey he
was the head of the OSS before it became the CIA he was our first CIA director and then he ran the SEC
securities exchange yes and helped there stack deep helped set
up our whole birth certificate fraud thing he also started the Spafford
Center under a different name back in the 30s and he died in 1975 and in 1983
this attorney bought it from Casey's law firm it's a corporation soul does
anybody know what a corporation soul is it's a corporation that started so old
that is grandfathered into under all laws it's a powerful corporation a
corporation soul was owned by William Casey wasn't Casey murdered i don't I
wish he was anyway and he can take children out of
New York City or any other county that he has one of his 17 agencies he can
show up at your house with a cop kick in your door his CPS agents take a
kid jump you through a bunch of parental hoops terminate your parental rights through his own judges and his own
guardianmental items and his own and he's licensed by the state to do
business he's protected under the commerce laws
he's sanctioned by the state when you run his name of his family services
companies on Google they come up higher than the actual state of New York's
family services in the search engines so if you're going to turn somebody into
CPS and you Google it good chance you're turning into a guy who set up hundreds of pedophile
companies because they do protect each other now what do you think about
that makes you want to stop being a teacher and grab a firearm and go start killing heads right this is how I feel
about it because I'm g I keep gathering the evidence keep turning in what if I
told you I tie that man in as the head of the tree and evidence branching off
him is what put Weinstein and Epstein in jail they're just small peas in the pot
they're just billionaires see it's easy to take down the bottom level
these are the four types of people we have in this country we have the sheep
they go about their daily lives they don't know anything we got the sheep dogs that's the ones that stand and try
and protect the sheep from the wolves and we've got the wolves and then we have the
bamps okay these guys are the
Illuminati did I spell that even close who cares who cares how I spelled it
illuminati they drink the blood of children they live off adrenrome
how many people use Google how many people use Android you know you support child
trafficking what is Google's operating system it's Adreno
what is their search engine chrome
how about Verizon who has Verizon mullik verizon worships the god of
Mullik i just found that out a week ago big corporations that we're all
supporting innocently and you're supporting child trafficking they fund it they create
foundations to pay the wolves to traffic their children these
guys are more numerous than you think many many many of them
it's bigger than that i've heard that they've got
armies oh yeah protectorates and armies ready to What if I told you they're most
of them pose as if they're helping the children what if I told you some of them
were UNICEF what if I told you they
were a lot of ex-military groups with special arrest
powers working under say veterans for children
so that's what I heard just and they're protecting the Illuminati and the vampires just recently I'd read that uh
they've got all these exmilitary and what if I told you that they put a price
on the head of people like Tim Holmes and me and others many many many vamps
but here's the group I want to talk about right now these are
uh county commissioners and mayors and attorneys and judges police officers
SWAT team leaders they're in our communities every
day and they're running legal businesses on the side what if I tell you I know a
SWAT team leader in California who when he was in the United States Army stationed in
Washington that the attorney that I was telling you about formed three corporations just for him under an alias
name three corporations while he was in the army after he left the army and he
became a police officer and he graduated his way up to SWAT and he's a SWAT team
leader for two counties he's won two awards in the state of California for the number one in surveillance in the
state of California and he's protected by everybody but he also protects
everybody what if I told you in the state of California in 41 counties the
sheriff is also the coroner and what if I told you he's also in the
Masonic Lodge and sometimes the sheriff's office the Masonic Lodge and the coroner's
office is all in the same building look at Plasterville look at Auburn there's two cities right there
they're in the same building so he could shoot you write the report cremate your body bury it cover
it up and he can do it on the behalf of a judge who told him to
so I got a question it's a perfect storm there's nobody to answer to but remember you can draw any circle
build a great wall of China in it you can write a name of an organization in it i don't care if it's the masons or
shriners or what it is okay and half of them have no idea what's going on and they're a good honest righteous people a
lot of builders are masons okay but until they reach those upper levels it's like this on the back of a $1 bill
you'll see this symbol this is the pendar this is the council of the 13
this is a council of 300 you can write the name of every organization on earth
and when it hits this level and it goes up into here it's controlled this is all
controlled by the Illuminati by the Pendar ultimately by the
Pendar you have to understand these things yes how they work so that you're
not blaming every Mason you're not blaming every one in every
organization it's like when I was turning in the evidence i was turned in and sometimes I'd get one person sometimes I'd get another and I found
out one's righteous and one's evil you find that out over time it's been bothering me
so anyway the wolves the wolves are the ones that set up
legal corporations to traffic children and
they're protected by the state anybody can bait a pedophile
i mean you can get an 18-year-old girl that looks like she's 12 and set her up in a little house out in the country
somewhere with great military fanfare after a pedophile shows up come in and arrest the guy anybody can that's called
baiting you can bait them and and they'll show up and you can take them
down and you can do it on highdefinition camera good camera equipment and you can put that on the the air and you can
raise a tremendous amount of money off that video and you can use it pretending
you're doing good work for children and he might have just been one of the ones you wanted to take
out because this is what happens now you got these legal corporations lawyers
judges family courts CPS you got you got trucking companies airlines
Solomar Airways based out of Boeing Field was set up by J scott Greer the
attorney I was telling you about in New York and Belleview a legal
airline but it flies cargo evergreen a legal
corporation the state can't interfere in commerce title 15 it protects them just
as well as it was I was telling you how to protect yourself [Music]
so the You think I learned this just by the state can't step in and do anything about No no they set up legal
corporations to do this and they do it under an alien's name so let's just say they set up a short distance trucking
company and you see a bunch of these little 20 foot trucks with the rollup doors right for local right usually they
always have an anesthesiologist or a dentist or a veterinarian or somebody who could drug the kids so it's quiet in
the back of the truck but let's say they didn't give them enough drugs and the kids are yelling and screaming they come up to a stoplight next to a cop car the
cop car hears all the screaming kids from the back of his truck he pulls a truck over well what the attorney did is
he goes in he sets up four or five of those companies and they do something like this jre one JRE 2 JRE 5 JRE 7
JRE9 and they set up all these trucking companies but they only use one at a
time so a truck gets caught switches to the next one the driver's the fall guy
he goes to jail they just changed the magnetic sign on the door to JRE2
does the driver even know sometimes not if they drugged them well enough a lot
of times the driver sit in their truck the car goes load in the back they hit the side of the car go ahead take it to
this location but he becomes a pacing when the cop stops him and he goes to jail
having a couple of kids in the back and they just do it again and do it
again and do it again and then their long distance trucking company is based out of Missouri operates on all coasts
different whole different company they set up logistics companies
some lady sitting at a desk lining up the loads she's just getting calls from
people telling them to I need a I need a load picked up here and dropped off here she's just organizing it all she's a
logistics company she's a compartment she's a compartmentalized legal idiot
set up by the vampires so does she know maybe not she's just
moving freight that's all she's doing yeah so there are a whole bunch of legal
corporations under the wolves
protected by the United States Code they can't interfere in commerce they're CPS
agents so how do we shut them down they're family courts how do you shut
them down you have to prove all elements of title child trafficking this is why I love our president right here if for if
for no other reason here's why I love him he made child and sex trafficking an
international crime so it falls under the UCMJ instead of the DOJ
uc so now I can turn the evidence in instead of to sometimes the FBI who covers up crimes for the deep state and
I can turn it into the military and hopefully I get an honest military who's on the right side of the wall
and then we can pick them up at 2 a.m we can put them on a C136 or a C5 and fly
them south hope they enjoy the heat for the short period of time they're going to be
there what if I was to tell you that one of the companies in Washington that that
attorney set up is a medical coding research company what if I told you
Obamacare was set up for one reason and one reason only and that's to traffic children
obamacare that's the only reason it was set up what if I told you that they invested so much money they built three
supercomputers in the university in Austin Texas that a
mother can go to her gynecologist find out that she's pregnant and the moment
he puts in the code the child traffickers are following that mother their pregnancy they know whether she's
going to get an abortion whether she has a live birth they follow the kid through the first few years of school they know
if it's got blonde hair blue eyes or red hair green eyes or whatever and what if
they got blood type DNA all your medical records obamacare coding system removed doctor
patient confidentiality from the United States and the world don't think it just
happened here it happened all over the world in every United Nations country when that was passed we started
it so it's a five-digit coding system with over 80,000 codes we call it
medical kidnapping in this country if you I I have parents that have walked into Phoenix Children's Hospital and
they can be up there with talking to their doctor their doctor writes stuff down in his notes he hands it to the medical coding expert in his office she
takes it she puts it in the computer cps and the Superior Court of Arizona lease
this space in the basement of the hospital a red flag pops up on the CPS agent's
computer down there she has every medical record the home address the parents name everything she can cut
paste put it on her documents an order to remove walk it next door to the judge
have him sign it get in the elevator be upstairs within five minutes taking the child
for on what ground whatever they want to think of
I heard they lease space in hospital they do
every hospital every hospital the courts and CPS every major hospital in the
United States they lease space but let me tell you something i'll tell you what they've told me they told me
all the evidence that we've turned in in the last three years it could take the military as long as 10 years just to
take care of it there's not enough people to even take care of it what if there were
sweetheart i'm going to tell you there is and we have a lot of help right
now and we haven't had that help for that long and I don't really want to talk too
much about it except oneonone in private maybe i'll show you some things okay but
we have a lot of help right now i always knew there was good and evil
i always knew that when people rise into a position of power a lot of times they
get very corrupted and they start committing the seven deadly sins and then Satan takes over
but what I didn't know until maybe five or 10 years
ago is that the whole world revolves
around child and human trafficking our entire
Think about what I told you about our birth certificates were being bought and sold
legally to fund governments all over the world this is why they can
afford to be so bloated to have agencies they're only supposed to provide us with
19 essential governmental services and no more they're providing us with 6,000 and forcing us at gunpoint to pay for it
but they're also using our trafficked selves
our trusts to fund that
here here's one thing about good and evil both they both have to disclose
ahead of time that's the universal nature of law they have to disclose
it and it's been disclosed for a long time but we just didn't never noticed
we don't pay attention that's right no plus it's like a puzzle okay they throw
away the box top and then they put one piece here and one piece here and one piece and you got to figure out well
gather up all the pieces figure out what is a piece gather up the pieces and then you got to put it together to see the
picture all right here's what's happening in China right now i've been to China three times in
the last five years six years i've traveled all over China by train many of the major
cities there are some of the most wonderful people on the face of the planet they love their families they
think it's a sin for their elderly to die in the hospital they take care of their kids they take
care of their families they use the spaces in between the freeways to grow gardens and farm pigs
they barter they trade they do many many things right and then you've got about
one million people in the Chinese government who are communists and h control a great deal of the money and
all the military might and this one million people who are communists there's about half a million
Muslims and then you've got all the rest of the people who stood
up and declared the fact that they wanted to join the sovereign government
of Mongolia and so the Chinese government used
their their weather manipulation weapons and they've been raining down on
China and flooding China and all their buildings they live up here and this is
commercial so they're flooding out all their commercial so the people are starving their restaurants are flooded
their grocery stores are flooded they all their supplies their toilet paper is
non-existent they're flooding all the cities with rain and storms the ones that can't flood they create lightning
lightning's so powerful it splits buildings in half that ain't natural
they're using all kinds of weather manipulation to genocide the people of
China who are trying to gain their sovereignty
most people don't it's easy to manipulate the weather
what if I told you off the coast of California about 150 miles out there's five shipping container ships these
ships are gigantic five of them tied end to
end and they have great big turbo fans on them about 15 feet and 20 feet in
diameter and they're aimed at our jetream and they can turn all those fans
on and they can manipulate our jetream and move it up they can shove it up into Canada in the winter time so it brings
ice cold to the northeast and the Great
Lakes they want heat they can shove the jetream down so it warms up over
California and Arizona and then it moves back up naturally and cooks and causes
tornadoes through Texas and Oklahoma and
Tennessee which creates hurricanes in the Gulf and Florida
Haiti they can move the jetream wherever they want
why aren't we torpedoing torpedoing those boats
sinking them because they're private for-profit corporations protected by the state we can't interfere in commerce we
can only regulate it has to be i mean be as dirty as they are
it's going to be up to us it's going to come down to we the people when we learn
and we decide enough is enough the part we have to understand when we do this is like kind versus like kind so when you
as a man or a woman go and try and sue a corporation it never works
you have to sue them as your corporation to sue them
okay when you go after a man you go after him as a man you can't go them
after as your corporation so what they try and do these attorneys aren't stupid they try and break your veil say it's
called breaking the veil whether it's a veil of a trust a veil a corporate veil or the veil of a man or a woman the
individual they try and break your veil so if you're not careful in your
documents if you're not careful in your words if you're not careful in your words verbally as well
as on paper then you combine jurisdictions in the wrong way you lose
and you don't know why you lose you go "Oh gosh we did everything right and somehow they just threw it out." Well
they throw things out on a technicality one of the main reasons they throw things out
is that you don't make your documents a quart of record first you take your document you write it you sign it you go
get it notorized and you go file it you skipped a step you didn't record it you
didn't publish it if you don't publish it it's not a court of record if it's a court of record it's a settled matter
then they throw it out they're committing a felony it's destruction of property
the problem is you need that county stamp on your document when it's
recorded in the court that shows the judge that it's
been publicly published so it's important to have that county recorder stamp on the top of your document when
you place it in the court but you have to do a certified proof of service sheet and I can I can give that to you
we will we'll bring this up tomorrow okay there's a reason this is a
three-day class today is wake you and shake you and hope you give you so much
information you want to come back tomorrow and we'll just keep learning you guys keep asking questions bring in
things you need to work on we'll keep learning that's what it's all about you learn as much as you can from me you can
use any county in the nation you want too some counties and some states charge
hundreds of dollars to record documents you can use Lamar County
Georgia for 10 bucks a document or Pima County Arizona for 30 bucks a document i just FedEx it down there give
them the money in the money order talk to the gals down there so you always
make four or five originals of your documents always when you study the law
you're going to find out that your documents become a court of record when they're properly served publicly
published and filed that's the three requirements and then they're a court of record what does that mean what does a
court of record mean it means they're on the record that they're
adjudicated they're there it's a truth it's filed
so they can't just pull them out and remove them now they're permanent that's a felony they the only time they can do
that is that if they completely close the case and wipe it off the face of the earth and sometimes you can force them
to do that in Gina Nelson's case here in Utah we filed over 700 pages of
documents she had already been tried found guilty by a jury before I met her
after I met her we filed 700 pages of
documents she got held in contempt three times for 29 days each went back to a
hearing the first time was to force her to try and have an attorney and she said "No no no he's fired for cause of fraud
and swindle and ineffective assistance council." Retroacted back to the very first second that's how you fire an attorney
by the way okay united States Code mentions the cause of fraud and swindle
right in it okay so they tried to they spent 30 days
trying to force her have an attorney she said "No no no no no i'm sudurous i'm sir." She kept standing upon her rights
then she mouththed off again they threw her in contempt to court
and they spent they spent 29 days showing up at the jail trying to get her
to sign a plea deal and she said "No no no i'm not signing anything i'm not signing anything i'm not signing
anything i don't have an attorney i'm not signing anything." They called her back in for a
hearing they threw her in jail for contempt of court trying to force her to have a psychological evaluation
she said to the psychologist when he came to the jail exactly what I told her to sign
say get tired exactly what I told her to say and that is this i had 13 years of
governmentont controlled curriculum government paid
for school system and I got a certificate of competency called a
diploma now Gina also had a degree in psychology
from the University of Utah so she told him that I had four
years to get a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Utah
and they gave me a certificate of competency called a degree
and then she said "And other than that I don't answer questions."
And so she was deemed competent and if you're competent and you don't have an attorney
to sign on your behalf and you don't sign on your behalf by taking a plea deal guess what they don't have enough
signatures to put you in jail so she walked out of the courtroom and went home so that's why
15 15 years of her life saved
after she had been tried and found guilty by a jury well how about I see you tomorrow
call the day you're welcomeyesterday I taught you in just a very short period of
Time how to just about win every single
time against those that are coming after you and what you need to do but I'm going to go in more depth in detail
today yesterday it was just about covering a lot of things just so that you know what it's really like out there
and what you really need to do a lot of people come to this with the idea oh
gosh I can I can do one thing that's going to change my status and that's it and it's not true
you have to do you have to do quite a few things to write the wrongs you've already made all
your life without knowing what you've been doing and you have to do those steps you write those wrongs and then in
the future from that point on your only job is to tell them no tell them no tell them no tell them
no correct the errors that they make and educate them so they don't do it again the rest of the time you can be
efficient that's what I say unfortunately it's kind of a full-time job for a lot of
people but all the documents that are mentioned
on on this I can get to you and that's the purpose of writing your email and stuff down um you send me a little note
says hey I need this I'm at this stage and I'll help you through that stage
okay that's what I'm here for I don't want you to feel like you leave here and this is what you got and you're left on
your own you're not now one thing I do want to mention
is when you take a document from
anyone and you use it it is your document it no longer is mine or whoever
else you got it from it's yours so you have to make it yours you have to remove
stuff out of there that doesn't apply and put in what applies to you okay so
make it yours a lot of times I've told this to people I've sent
them documents they send it back to me and say hey can you look this over for me make sure it's all right and I go
well wait a minute what about this and this and this did you read this document
did you check it to make sure everything applies to you because I bet it doesn't
you know and go from there so just know that up
front any legal form you have to make it
yours and again I'm going to remind you attorneys write
forms everybody says oh Do you have a template for that oh God I hate that
word template I hate it worth of passion and I get that 10 times a day do
you have a template for that attorney's right forms to remove
the liability from them and place it upon you they're filled with lines and
boxes and things that don't belong there they're filled with
language that removes their liability from them and plac it upon you a lot of
people think oh I can just go down the county courthouse and they've got this form that I can fill out and and and get
my case started and no they're screwing you when you do
that and you don't even know it so be very careful with any form any
contract you sign attorneys run this work world and
that's who we the people are at war with and it's sad to say so we're going to we
are going to talk about the eight elements of a contract today but when you go through this steps
I'm going to go through it really quick because we didn't yesterday we just kind of handed it out the number one most important thing
is to change your status status standing in jurisdiction is everything in the law I cannot say that enough it's incredible
L important if you don't know who you are don't expect to
win expect to lose that's kind of a harsh statement
now they think about it but we walk in by General appearance we
just show up we're asked to plead guilty or not guilty both our commercial terms
you never plead guilty and you never plead not guilty
you declare your innocence
okay guilty and not guilty are commercial terms you declare your
innocence all right so the very first thing again is the Affidavit of repudiation most important thing you can
do once you send that off it is not finished and it is not
complete you must get the certified proof of service I recommend you send it
registered mail not certified registered with return receipt
requested get the return receipt do the sheet that say certified
proof of service sheet which I can give you once you do that from the date that
they received it you have to give them 21 days to
respond they never respond but on the 22nd day you do the
certified Judgment of unrebutted
affidavit it's a certified Judgment of unrebutted
affidavit because they did not respond they acenedithiophenes
you're judg menting it you put all three of those documents
together and then you go record them with a county that's called
publicly publishing them so we publicly publish our
documents your documents become a court of record when they're properly served
publicly published and then filed okay if you have no reason to file the
document right away because you're not in trouble you file it at home in your file cabinet and you
wait and you're going to use that document later I'm sure I'm
positive but at least it's on their public record it's publicly published anyone can find it if they want to
search Okay then if you're able some people aren't because of child support
and other aspects but if you're able you go get your passport on this document I tell you
exactly how to do a passport I mean I spelled it out for you because a lot of
people get it wrong post offices
are transfer stations they are not who issues your passport all they do is
collect the information and they send it to the passport
agency 99.997% of the time they're doing it for
US citizens that means they are doing it a certain way over and over and over and
over again the same way all the time so if you're expecting to change your status to a State national they don't
know how to do that at the post office okay and they can't communicate
it to the guy that's issuing the passport and because of that a lot of State
Nationals do not get a State national passport when they go through the post
office and they've had to learn this the hard way okay so you have to go to the
passport agency that issues the passport a state department office unfortunately living in Utah your
closest one is Denver you could go to Seattle if you want to hit the coast or you can go to San Francisco if you want
to go see this the freaks down there Define State national one who owes their
allegiance to the state in other words that's what you were all born by the way
uh you were born as Californians and oregonians and uton and wisconsinites
and Floridians and Texans that's a State national okay everyone was born that
way and then you grew up and you started checking boxes that you were us Citizen
and you volunteer to be a citizen a person and a resident the definition of
citizen for the city means Municipal Zen is servant
Municipal servant same thing as a public servant
an employee of government it's exactly what it means a person is a
vessel or entity Corporation an office of it's defined as all those
things an office of so you can think of it as you get a job on board a ship
you're an office officer of that ship you're also the signatory officer of
that ship so you sign the bills of leting you pay the bills you pay the
port taxes that's what you do as a person a person is not a man in fact the
Bible says be the man and not the person don't put flattering titles of person upon the man for if you do it's a sin
and he will surely take you away so he tells us not to be the
person in this day and age there are times when you pretty much have to be
I'd like it if we didn't have to be but sometimes we have to be right now just
to defend ourselves and to to hold our public servants accountable that's the main
time where we have to step into court prosay is when we're going after
them so we're going in representing our person when we're going after
them when we're defending oursel we're Sue jurist we're of One's Own rights
we're a man or a woman
okay all right number three is a deed of
reconveyance this reconvey your ownership of your all Cap's name which is your vessel to your Christian name so
in other words it's tying the two together it's taking ownership the man or woman is taking ownership of the
vessel this must be recorded to make it a court a record if it's not recorded
you haven't taken ownership it's that simple you got to record your title now
if possible I am a firm believer in a patent of nativity the reason being is a
patent of nativity shows that you existed on this
land before there even was a government not everybody can do that for those that do genealogy it's pretty easy you know
if if you can trace the history and I could show you mine on my iPad but mine has my family
crest on it from Germany from the 14 or 1500s and then it has my father's
lineage and my mother's lineage back I only went back on that patented
Nativity prior to 1776 that's as far back as I care if you
go but if you can trace your family on these Shores back before 1776
then you're grandfathered okay you your DNA was on
these Shores before government even existed these documents what they do is
they show intent intent I was going to go over that today anyway might as well
do it right now intent is very important in the law you C if you don't have intent to commit a crime you really
didn't commit a crime theyve got a court has to prove you had intent to commit it
okay um so any of these documents uh anavon
R's 928 docs those kind of things those those don't do anything for
you as far as changing your status but they prove your intent that
you wanted to change your status does that make sense without an affidavit to the
Secretary of State as far as the United States law is concerned you haven't
changed your status they Define your status in title 8 section 1101 of the US
code and says here it is here's the definitions here's all the different things you can be and then we have the
unable right of self-determination which is free our free agency to pick which
one we want to be and then notify them in writing under the penalty of perjury
which is an affidavit and let them know who we want to be
somebody at the Department of State takes those affidavit and they put it into the computer
system usually takes them 30 to 60 sometimes 90 days who knows how long
with covid but they put it into the system
eventually and they can pull it up
police yeah that's a terrible name I sheep yeah see the Sheep
surrender okay
so you know it probably could it's good to if you can do it on the paternal and the maternal side both all the way
down okay now if you can't do a patent and Nativity you'll notice on the sheet
that I put if possible and then a decoration optional if you can't do the
patent of nativity do a declaration declare who you are and that
you belong here okay and record it if you can do two to three documents
and I prefer three try and always achieve three
things one of them changes your status and the other two prove your intent so if you've got multiple things
to prove your intent it's like having multiple Witnesses this was my intent to do this nobody forced me into it nobody
CER me into it number six if you are a property owner and and that doesn't just
mean a house could mean your car household goods anything if you're a
property owner you need to have your Superior title so if you have your house
you need to put it back in the original land patent now what does that mean put it
back in the original land patent it's kind of vague no the land
patent is underlying the land someone someone many
years ago usually in the 1800s patented a piece of land maybe it
was you know 360 Acres or 640 acres or
160 Acres right that land was given to that person for
labor that he put into it and a small fee that he had to pay and usually that
land patent was signed by a president of the United States to that
person's himself his heirs successors and or assigns
forever so even the government can't take it back okay
Now by posting the land patent number on your
property and remember now you may just own that little lot on the corner and it
was 160 Acres right so it's a part and parcel thereof and the lot has a meets
and Bounds description it says from this marker that might be way over there it's
so many feet to your property corner and then it's so many feet from that property corner to that property corner
to that property corner to that property corner and back to that one that's a
meets and Bounds description okay so you have to put it in meets and
Bounds and like I read off on this tax statement
yesterday this man's property he's got three watts and it sits on two land
patent number 6743 and
6747 but what did they change as legal description to lot 76 a stable Acres subdivision is
that a meets and Bounds no that's SMU that made
up okay this is what they go by they create
an invoice with a whole bunch of errors and we write them a check and send it in
pay our property taxes now we just acquin to all their
errors so they stole the property the county steals the property
on behalf of the state from you you get a warranty deed an abstract
of title what is an abstract F that's right it's something
it that represents something it's it's a fallacy it's a color of law okay so you
get a you get a warranty deed and you go oh man I own my first home great and you
don't even own it the state can come in and take it away from your fore clothes on you get you if you don't pay a couple
years back taxes I don't know what these houses around here go for but let's just say that's 300,000 bucks for that corner
house on that L on the park right I don't know what it's worth I don't know
property values around here but let's just say it's worth $300,000 you get a property tax bill in
the mail for $37.75 and you don't pay it for three
years you owe 3,000 four thou rough just under $4,000 total and the county comes
in and takes your $300,000 house for $4,000 bucks is that
right no but they can do do it because you didn't know in the first place you
have in the law it states this you have the right to make a profit and incure a
loss that's your privilege for buying that house you might have put $50,000 cash down and owe
250 right but you have the right to make a profit and cure lives I don't think
that's fair so let's do something about
it yes it would be considered a loal status the king's land you own it nobody
else can a loal
um Ron Gibson wrote a book about L called land patents Ron's a good friend
of mine I've known him since 2009 or 10
um he and I put our properties in land patent about the same period of time
back about 2009 or 10 anyway
uh he went on to study the process and ended up writing a book about it and ended up being a professor at the
University of Southern Oregon down in Medford teaching land patents mainly to
the miners Miners and those guys want to know all about land patents because they
want the mineral rights right anyway in the first first 100 pages of his book is
nothing but law one paragraph after another of how
that once you have it in land patent they can't take your property from it there's a 100 Pages case law just in the
front of his book on page 114 he teaches you how to put your
property in land patent sorry Ron Gibson if you want the book it's 45 five
bucks and uh I can get you either his email or a lot a lot of people PayPal me
and I send it down and give the book to you
but you know they can they can if they had right at some point in time let's
just say it was an owner who owned your house 30 years ago and now all of a sudden he says hm I'm
65 years old I need a place to live the rest of my life he had a security interest in at
one time he could go take accept the last grant deed in the patent kick your
ass out wow so my understanding of the current system if we own real estate and we want our children to benefit from it
they have to pay state taxes on that if we bequeath it to them that's without the land patent option that's real
estate law well sure but they don't own it either the state owns it yeah you're not giving them anything except the
opportunity to make a profit or in cure loss in other words they'd have to sell it in a high Market to actually for you
to give them anything otherwise you cost them something if they lose it or you
know anyway if they've got to put in a road or a highway that that was basically written
in the law way back when there was land patents for they they wrote it in for
railroad purposes wagon roads postal roads all those reasons and really every
road here is a postal Road people don't know
that oh imminent domain the difference is they've got to pay you market value
for it if you have the land patent they got to pay you market value okay so they
can't condemn your property they've got to pay you market value but you have to sell if you fight them on selling then
they can condemn it but if you don't declare war you just say all right here's two
appraisals this is what it's worth give me the money you can put in your road
there's not much you can do about that
but get them as high as you want
well the the point is the way our country was founded on Christian
principles is that giving up the property is for the greater good of
all I know that's hard that's harsh actually to me have to say that to you
but it is and that's the way the law original laws were written way back when
that you give it up for railroads for uh postal roads for things that are to the
greater good of all of us and you give it up but if you've got a land
patent your status is right you get fair market value they they can't come in and
offer you 50 grand for a $300,000 house just to put a road
Ines well it has to be third party independent market value people so you got to get
two or three values on your car your or
trailers or whatever's licensed on the road
typically you need to have your MCO or MSO your manufacturer statement of origin in Europe they call it the
manufacturer certificate of origin so it depends on if it's a Volvo or if it's a Ford or Chevy right
but it's either an MSO or an MCO most of the time it's MSO you said
we can't well here's the issue once the state gets it they don't tend to give it
up so how do you get around that Salvage
Maritime Salvage laws okay how would you do that though you
get a mechanic to lie like hell and say it's total see see that Lexus right there
that sucker total yeah see and that's what you have
to do to to get a salvage title once you get a salvage title in hand don't register it there are some people that
are woke up that'll pay more for one with a salvage title than a good one because they don't have to register it
you've already done their work for them so all you got to do is find somebody that's awoke if you don't if you find
somebody that wants to go register it they're not going to pay as much right
to take dominion over the air you must have a trust if you don't have an Express which is a written trust then
they will imply a trust so since we're here this a good
point to tell the story for those that weren't here and I'll tell it fairly quickly so pay attention all right April
22nd I think it was I taught a just a one-day class at
the Department of Justice and after I was done a little attorney came up to me and he
said can I tell you a story of what I learned from my father
and his history was his father was a judge and his grandfather was a judge he
came from a long line of judges and he was a graduate of Georgetown law and he
went to work for the Department of Justice so that's his story but he said when he was 16 years
old he got to sit in on one of his dad's classes and his dad was teaching new
judges judges who just been voted in or appointed or
whatever and his dad said that when a man walks into a
courtroom the very first thing he sees is a little plaque up on the judge's desk that says you're honorable Bob
Smith or whatever his name is the reason for that is honor is the
first hat the judge has to put on that's his first job title your honor you can't
have trust without honor you can't have honor without trust so the three jurisdictions being land air and water
the land being common law common to all mankind is property equity and rights The Heir being ecclesiastical or canon
law which is trust law and the water being an admiralty or Commerce which is contract law those are our three
jurisdictions of law he said when a man walks into the
courtroom the your honor playing the part of your honor is looking for the
man to have an Express trust in hand but if the man doesn't walk in with
an Express trust which they seldom do then the judge implies a trust where
the judge is the executive the man's a trustee who somehow mismanaged the Trust on behalf
of the beneficiary who's a prosecution so therefore because of his mismanagement he owes the prosecution
something the beneficiary something but if the man walks in with
an Express trust in hand that clearly states who the executive is and it's not the judge and it clearly states who the
trustee is and has an acceptance of the trustee to be the trustee so it can't break the veil of the
trust tells exactly who the beneficiary is and it's not the
prosecution and it describes the property to be managed and how it's supposed to be
managed then there's nothing left for the judge to adjudicate in that jurisdiction of the
air because he's got his Express Trust in hand so the judge swaps hats and he
goes to a judge hat now he's looking for one or two things is there a victim then there's a
crime it's criminal it goes to trial if there's not it's civil and we know in this country that just about all crimes
are civil it goes civil which means he's looking for the
man to walk in with his Superior titles in hand now think about that that's not
just if it's a car case it's your MSO if it's a your house case it's a patent or
grant deed right but what if it's about your kids you got your birth certificate and
your claim of right and your your your claim the vessel is your
property it's your Superior titles it's your Superior title did you bring your birth certificate in I mean you might
need it to pay the debt see so it's your Superior titles in
hand if you did walk in with him then he can't apply an abstract of
title so therefore there's nothing for him to adjudicate and he takes that hat off and he puts on a Mr administrator
hat now he's in the jurisdiction of the water he's looking to see if you have your business Affairs in order do you
have your copyrights and your trademarks do you have your contracts are your contracts in order if you've taken
dominion over that and every your business Affairs are in order there's nothing for him to
adjudicate so he takes that hat off and he throws his hammer down and he leaves the room case
closed but if we walk in taking Dominion leaving them nothing to
adjudicate we win every time so that's the key to winning a court case it's
taking dominion over all three jurisdictions land is common law common in all mankind it's property equity and
rights it's things given to us by God everything we have was either
grown or it was mined everything came from God we didn't
make anything we might have formed it into something but everything was given to by
him so he is always the executive in my trust okay the trust has to contain
certain elements has to have an executive it has to have a trustee the
trustee is called a fiduciary a fiduciary is the highest form of law
when you have a fiary responsibility over another a judge can't get in
between those okay a fiary fiary fiary is that
the truste hey I speak to far animals I don't pronounce things right
all the time theary the truste the trustees a
fiary yeah okay you must have a written acceptance
by the trustee to be the trustee now this is what most people leave out of their trust and this is why Good
attorneys break a trust Veil they break the veil and hold you
you personally responsible to be the
trustee you you you can't just take it upon yourself you have to accept it it's
not really a letter it's actually more like an affidavit yes and it's an
acceptance of a trustee i h i have a copy of it we can email it to you which is if someone else appoints you as
trustee you still have to accept the trustee I mean I I have the straight
Familia God trust straight family God trust okay God is the
executive it's ran by righteous principles I have a property list that's
attached to that that covers any property you could possibly ever own now or in the future okay and
then I have an acceptance that I'm the trustee and then my heirs successors
Ander assigns forever would be my kids my grandkids on down
forever benefici they're the beneficiaries so now as you buy more property you have to do some kind of no
my property list covers it all anything I ever would do in the future the
trust must show the property assets and income of the trust must be clearly
stated describe how the trust should be managed the trusts are signed in the
center of the document trust should be recorded and anchored to the land if
possible so make them a quarter record anchor them to the land trust or private
even though you're making it public what you're doing is notifying them that there is a trust now you do not have to
file the trust itself you can actually write up a separate document which is
the notice of existence of trust and record it you can do that or
you can just record your trust there's nothing in your trust to hide go ahead and just record it if there's something
you don't want known maybe you don't want your kids' names known then don't record it it's up to
you you can you can record a notice the of an existence of a trust in
1791 was written the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
that is my gun permit that is my concealed weapons
permit okay I don't need a concealed weapons permit I don't need a gun permit
I need don't need to tell them what they I can own and what I can't own I don't care if it's a bump stock or a a
magazine that holds 50 rounds or 100 okay instead of 10 like in California
you can only have 10 Rounds I don't even own anything that holds 10 Rounds okay if the military can
have it I can have it if it's an M1 tank or an A10 I'll take it okay that's true
and they can't tell me any different because I can have anything as a militia that our military can have but you have
to be a militia we all are militia like it or
not every man of Able Body AE you don't have to be declared
militia you were declared a militia in the constitu ution so the minute you're
a state Citizen State national or a US citizen you're part of the
militia so yes they do the FBI doesn't but
they're not government the FBI is a private for-profit Corporation without a corporate charter do you know they have
no authority to even exist I have a letter from the Library of Congress the
said the FBI was created by a secretary at the Department of Justice a secretary
that was not appointed by the president nor appointed by the head of the Department of Justice nor by Congress
therefore they have no authority to make law and a secretary created the FBI in
1908 to protect the Deep State they have they they follow up on six basic crimes
that the Deep state State commits to cover up crimes for the Deep State and I don't care if this is on video to the
whole freaking world all right they have no corporate charter to even exist and
when they asked Congress for one they were denied see you know what gives the FBI Authority they walk in with their
suit and tie and the best forensics in the whole world and they walk up to the sheriff and they intimidate the out
of him and they say we're taking over the case
and they do it with authority and the Sher goes okay it's
yours yes he could he could tell him to get the hell out of his County but he
doesn't because he's weak because he didn't have any law classes kindergarten through 12th grade
either serious they don't they don't know their job you know who comes in the sheriff's departments and trains the
sheriffs and their deputies the county attorney
the County Attorney trains them I'm telling you attorneys run everything in this country they run all the police
departments that's why it says police on the side of their car it's policy Revenue enforcement collection agent
that's all they are they have no no desure Authority at all they're de facto none government operates through
the consent of the government since governments have chosen to incorporate themselves they must follow the same
rules as any other corporation that rules codes statutes and ordinances are not law they're corporate bylaws they're
for employees of the corporation to fall so they make you a citizen or by your
own consent and agreement and therefore you're an employee of government so you got to
follow the same rule they do you got to follow all the statutes and all the rules and all the policies and all the
codes and everything else because you're an employee you're no different than them yet the United States code was
written and passed by we the people through our legislature to hold our Public Service accountable and they at
the Department of Justice come after you and they write a whole bunch of United States code in they that they're holding
you accountable for this code and this code and this code and you oh shoot I'm in trouble
call a lawyer and then you go to jail and they put you in jail because of these codes
these codes don't even apply to a man or a woman they don't apply to a free man they don't apply to a State national at
all as a state National you have limited diplomatic Community as long as you don't kill somebody rape beat them over
the head with something okay unless you injure another party there's no
crime okay this is where we got to wake up I get a little revved up don't I what
is this what I'm looking for is it's
uh it's it's dour it's desure what is
United States yes it is de facto de facto is
without fact jurus is Right law desure jur is
right so one our rights okay
now this is a corporation it is a subsidiary
Corporation of the District of Colombia the District of Colombia is a
subsidiary Corporation of the crown
Inc okay H the crown
Inc it is DC is its own city nation
state Manhattan Island is its own city nation state Westminster is its own city
nation state and the Vatican is its own city nation state these are called the four
pillars all right so Manhattan is part of that fourar Manhattan is not
Manhattan is owned by the United Nations which is owned by
the crown and it actually goes through a chain the Council of Foreign Relations the
international monetary fund the World Bank the United Nations the
crown ultimately all of those are owned by the pindar it's on the dollar it's
the all cing ey there's 13 blocks here this a Council of 13 there's 300 blocks
here it's a council of 300 I drew a dashed line right here and
I drew a line down from there representing corporations going from the bottom to the top as people rise to a
position of power and authority they get corrupted they start committing the seven deadly sins they're now controlled
by the Council of 300 Council of 300 is controlled by the Council of
13 which is controlled by the pindar the pindar used to be the queen of England
the queen of Holland and the Vatican Pope Benedict removed the Vatican from the pindar it's the Queen of England the
queen of Holland and TVM now he is not the rightful person to
belong in that position he will be removed and I believe he has been removed but I don't
have confirmation on it yet Ben Benedict did a lot of great things for the world WR it in his last
few days okay
yes absolutely he in fact he literally dissolved all corporations in the
world is what he did yes because when you look at corporations this is an
interesting thing you go start a corporation right ABC company I don't care what it is you register it with the
state it's now under the state's Corporation it's a subsidiary Corporation the states under the United
States corporation which is under DCS which is under the CR your corporation's under the crown every
corporation in the world is tied together as one this is why when people kind of
mistakenly say a person is an entity or a corporation is not a person is a
vessel The Vessel and the vessel is registered with the state okay but we're
really a ship let me clarify that for just a second international waters are
What shipping right in yeah Mar Maritime
open to Inland piracy okay when you're a vessel you're
in international waters that's why the high water marks at the top of the mountain in Colorado we're all we're all
underwater okay Christ says walk upon the Water follow me have faith and I'll
teach you to be the Fishers of Men and be able to feed the whole village he's teaching us to take dominion over
commerce when he says that when Moses when he taught Moses to part the waters
and walk upon the land he was teaching him to take dominion over the land the
Bible is a wonderful thing and you once you start learning what I'm teaching you you start reading it in a whole new
light okay well that's now it just makes me want to read the Bible instead of
reading it to be church I want to read it to behind the facts that's right
that's right everything that I'm understanding now as they get deeper into the pedophilia and deeper into all
the other stuff it all RTS back to scripture it is full of trust IND
Dentures where he tells someone you this is your land the land
of Canaan it's yours it's for the benefit of your HS forever right that's a trust indenter
okay all through the Bible are written trust indentures the very first one is
Genesis 1 26 through 225 is a trust indenture it has all
elements of a trust in that first book first and second book of the
Bible and it's God as the executive giving me man dominion over the land the
air and the water and everything there in and telling me me to manage it for
the benefit of humanity of our Hees to
for the for the future forever what is the legal definition of the word forever
it's until the end of the Earth forever is until the end of the Earth then it becomes eternity right
it's in perpetuity forever no one can take that Dominion away from me so once I establish Dominion guess what no one
can take that Dominion away from from me no judge can take it nobody I could just kick his ass if I
will wanted to create a business that makes money I would create a business
that's a PMA why because I have more control over it and less regulation over
it okay makes sense that's why I would do it I would create a private
membership Association everybody that walks through the door becomes a member
okay when you have a private membership Association you don't have to register it with the state you're never under the
jurisdiction of the state you're under the jurisdiction of all
members so Gina's gymnasium up here it's a child's gymnasium in Logan every child that pays
$29.95 a month a dollar a month goes towards her membership fee they're members will sign
on the front door not open to the public open to all members they they walk in they pay them
every month's dues includes a $1 membership fee all their
employees are member owners of the business what I've said here is the
state the United States of America is dour United States is Dea facto the state of Utah
which is who the governor is in charge of is a corporation with its corporate charter
held at 44 Northwest Congress Avenue Washington D.C it's not even in the
Utah so you have Utah a State national would be a uton
who runs his own desure government of Utah is
self-governed the governor runs the state as the way this nation's
corporations were set up they only have control over their agencies not over
you but because you claim to be a citizen you're part of their
agencies so she thinks she can mandate her employees this is how she's getting away
with it or he's getting away with it it's a woman in my state Technically
she's only supposed to tell her agents what to do so you have to stand up and say wait
a minute I not acting as an agent I'm acting as a we the
people you can only tell your agencies what to do you can't force me to do it
this is why they're running this test right now they're looking to see how many people are going to comply they put
cameras everywhere for this event do you know that all your street lights have cameras everywhere's cameras they're
also training their cameras yes for facial
recognition of your eyes yes it's blocking this part of your
face on purpose so the computer learns how to recognize just your eyes
the nla wrote a very good comprehensive constitutional Sheriff's handbook you
can go to their website you can yep you can buy it you can donate money to them
and as the money comes in they send out hundreds of copies so they'll send them
out for you if you just donate to them and pay for them they'll send them out
they're trying to get them to every police force every Sheriff they started with the county sheriffs every County
sheriff in this country now has one now they're working on police forces they're trying to get them
in the hands of every Deputy they want the deputies to have them you know why they want the deputies to have them they
want them to take them home a night set them on their coffee table and then pick them up occasionally and read them and
that way the deputies decide am I being ordered to do
something that I'm not supposed to be doing well understand this okay right
now none of these cities police forces take an oath to the Constitution that's
what I none of them do and they're the Beav of the mayor the only ones that take an oath are the counties the county
sheriff's the county deputies none of the city police forces taken oath that's
requ that's right that's right if a police a city police pulls you over
starts giving you a hard time you say hold on a minute I'm calling the sheriff and you call your county sheriff
and you say hey as a member of your county I am having a problem right now
with a city Deputy can you come help you got to
recognize that cop's not going to let you get on that phone no he's
yeah look they'll tell you to put the phone down here here's the thing we're supposed to know who we are we're
supposed to be at peace until we're backed into a corner we don't let anyone override us
we are the boss they can override us now I'm not saying go out and declare war on
them because that's a wrong thing to do they will kill you guarantee it okay but
be at peace fly the Peace Flag the dash of my pickup has a Peace Flag right in
the pastor's Corner CU now now days the police are walking up to that side of the car most of the time okay do
they I don't care if they understand it or not most of them are exmilitary officers
most police officers the police departments want to
hire low IQ X army officers why because
the army officers at the lower ranks fall orders to the
tea so they're already programmed they do not want high IQ
officers in fact I know guys who have gone to the academy who were pretty smart and intelligent and were smart
enough if they wanted to be a cop to miss questions on purpose so that they could get their
badge now that sounds terrible but that's what they want they want lower IQ order followers ones that when
they give an order to follow a policy when the County Attorney walks in or the City attorney walks in and trains the
officers in the police department how to collect Revenue it's all their training
statute is about Revenue how to collect Revenue they want them to follow those
orders they don't want them to think for themselves and that's pretty darn sad
makes me mad okay because there's a lot of good guys
a lot of good guys who are cops but I've seen my share of bad ones
too I absolutely want to create a legal
business I want to create a legal business for one purpose only
they try to force you to pick no it's because we have to take dominion over all three
jurisdictions so if I start a business ABC Inc I don't care what it's called
I've had one for since 1982 called straight Enterprises but that tells you how old I am all right ABC
Inc it has to have the
intent to make a Prof
profit it has to be registered with the
state now when I register it with the state I wanted to clearly
state that it has the intent to make a profit and that it's going to have
products offered for sale in international Commerce just put it in the notes
section at the bottom yes this is a key okay International
Commerce now that usually requires a
website or some way to get your product out there does
it it has to have an offering and offering so a product
offered for sale a product or service or just
a well for the purpose of this I'm going
to tell you a product not a service I'll tell you
why now you see this bag right here it says Costco Wholesale on it
that's a trademark name Costco Wholesale is a trademark name they placed it on a
product offered for sale in international Commerce with the intent to make a
profit very key so again thank Michael Jordan and Nike for just a minute I like
to use that because I'm pretty proud of the guy if you can get a billion
over a 5year period 200 million a year for the use of your name give it to them
sign the contract that's a pretty good Gig if you can get it so if I took my children's
names and my grandchildren's names and my
name and I what I mean by that is the
all caps name the vessel and I trademark
them all doing a bulk trademark under ABC Inc
with the United States Patent Trademark Office on their
T's plus
form telling you how to do this right now go to their website do the it's an
online form so you sit there on your t's plus form form and you put your all caps
names of you and your kids register them as trademarks under your
corporation now let's just say I take my kid and I I'll just throw one of my
daughter's names up here and I take my kid her full name's
trademarked and I put her name well first of all I sign a contract
with ABC Inc and her with her signatory
officer officer and I signed a contract offering
her 20% of the
profits and then our print her name on some bags or some t-shirts or some
pens or whatever I don't care make magnetic signs stick them on the side of
your car I don't care what you do but then I take let's say I go buy a
half a dozen different color t-shirts there's a reason I'm telling any t-shirts and I lay them out on a white
sheet at home on the bed and I take a picture of them and I put them on the website and I offer them for sale
for $20 plus 20 yes there's a reason for
the $20 so I offer these t-shirts for sale for $205 I don't care all
right I've got a contract with the business got her trademark names on
t-shirts something happens and my grand hiss names and she has five kids now by
the way I tell her I'm way too young to be a grandfather with five kids from one
of my youngest daughters
okay and she lives in Utah all right
so I put their names on this t-shirt right now we got a problem at the court or they want to steal her
kids I throw that t-shirt on I walk into court with her TR Mark names and I don't
talk about the facts of the case or anything I talk about her status her
standing her jurisdiction how she's taken dominion over all three jurisdictions the land
the air and the water and I say judge do you really think you should be interfering in
Commerce do you really think you should be infringing upon a
trademark how about right now we just demand the return of our property and any document that you place
that name upon without our prior written express permission be
destroyed see he's really worried right now because he opened himself up to a
great deal liability once we've explained and notified him with a proper notice called
a notice of appearance of how we were going to appear by special appearance
under what status having taken Dominion of our three jurisdictions he's already
been notified in the law which we've already recorded it with the county made that document a court record and we
filed it upon the court case and then we walk into a hearing because Lady Justice has two ears a must
hear and now we just ask for summary
judgment we demand the return of our property we have all documents destroyed
and the case dismissed and we all go home happy and
it takes me 15 minutes or so
okay this is you're talking above a level he understands what you're saying but he's like holy SM oh he scared it in
his Booth see see the difference is most people walk into a courtroom and they're shaking they're scared and they're
afraid and they're timid I walk in smiling skipping how you
do I want the prosecutor and I want the judge shaking I want them shaking in
their boots wondering what the hell I know and what I'm up to so I walk in there with a whole different attitude I
own the place the minute I walk in no misdemeanor okay I'm at
peace but I'm prepared to out debate them and that's all it is is knowledge
eliminates your fear the only fear is from lack of
knowledge if you're scared of mountain climbing or rock climbing or hang
gliding is because you don't know all the aspects of it you haven't taken all the safety precautions I've strapped a
parachute off and ran off the side of the Grand Canyon landed at the ranch below and rode the donkeys
up it's called Bas jumping it's a blast okay so when you planned it out
you're not AF afraid in the courts you shouldn't be afraid in a courtroom it's just having a little bit of knowledge
what you've learned and are going to learn this weekend if you prepare yourself with the
proper documents ahead of time you shouldn't be as scared of going to court ever again in your
life now they're going to try things they're going to try and throw out constitutional bear traps for you to
step in and get them wrapped around your ankles and they're going to try and get you to say more than is
necessary see you got to learn what to say and then learn how to shut
up anything you say can will be used against you so when I A lot of people
are man they just rattle off rattle off and hang
themselves the key is and we're going to talk about Dynamic
negotiation we're going to talk about what that means okay but the key is to
throw something out there ask them a question in the form of a question is
always better don't try not to make statements throw it out there in the
form of a question now when you're taking Authority you make
statements when you're getting that put placing the burden of proof upon them
you're asking questions and the burden of proof always on them okay so you shut up I know a guy
that was just walking down the street not minding his own business not doing nothing this cop car pulls up and it's
like pacing him as he's walking down the sidewalk the guy the cop finally rolled
his window down asked him to stop and the guy's looking at him like
what' I do right and the cop asked him to sit on
the ground it's
ridiculous okay no no you don't gosh I'd be have to show up and bail you out
again don't do dumb things all right these guys are just people don't
have any fear just don't say anything that's necessary so anyway this cop started
asking all these questions I don't answer questions
on the advice of counsel I don't answer questions cop says what is your
name and at that point after saying I don't answer questions and on the advice of counsel I don't questions that's
notice number one notice number two cop says what is your name he zipped
his lip well this young aggravated cop who is looking for somebody that might meet
that description who might have robbed a Circle K down the street puts him in his cop car and puts
handcuffs on him and all the way to the station the cop was trying to get him to
answer questions and he just smiled and shut up
didn't say a word they take him to the police station they put him in a little
room they come in they start ask him questions he just shuts up doesn't say a
word doesn't give him his name doesn't give him his address doesn't give him anything after about an hour and a half
the police got pretty darn Fed Up and tired and they let him out the door and
he went home that's a good
scenario did you sue him H later no n he
didn't it's not wor sometimes you got to judge whether it's worth an effort right but the fact is they could have
done a lot more he could have told them his name told them his address they they you know people just
say things that they don't even think incriminates them and it does there's some good videos on YouTube you probably
ought to watch the pot Brothers do a really good job look up the pot Brothers
po p yeah po there are a couple of attorneys in Denver Colorado when they legalized pot in
Colorado uh that they help people get out of trouble but they do it for a number of different reasons just not pot
I mean traffic stops all kinds of things and they tell you they shut the up basically okay
that's exactly how they say it but there when you pull up one of their videos over on the side they usually have
related videos and I've seen some very good related videos that they didn't
even do that are there and they're usually from attorneys telling people
how they incriminate themselves so the number one thing we do to get in trouble is run our mouths one of the problems
you have in Utah and I'm going to tell you this I over the last 20 years have
helped a lot of cases in this state too high of a percentage when
there's 50 states that I work in and I look at the number of cases I've had in
Utah I just H start to wonder why right
well the problem is this is you got the probably the world's
biggest good old boy Network right here and they all go to church with each
other on
Sunday and that's what I'm saying about this you want to take dominion over the
water just make up some T-shirts offer them for sale on the internet
write your contracts Michael Jordan wrote a contract with Nike for five years one billion doll 200 million a
year and a police officer couldn't even write Michael Jordan's name on a ticket without the prior Express written
permission of Nike so if they can't get ABC inc's permission ahead of time to
write Chris's name or one of hear kids on their
documents that document ment must be destroyed title 15 of the United States
code becomes your savior at that point title 15 regulates
Commerce and it says they can regulate commerce but they can't interfere in it
remember yesterday I sat here for a second we were talking about court and I
said the minute they called my name and I stand up and I take my first step I'm already talking I'm here by special
appearance calling for a constitutional Court of record to ask for a summary
judgment of the truth and the facts placed upon the record by my documents and then I shut
up I've already told them in my documents how I'm going to appear what
my status is everything now I just told them I'm by special appearance so that I
don't turn over jurisdiction there's only two ways to appear in court for those who weren't here yesterday by
General appearance or by special appearance by General appearance you're turning over jurisdiction to them you're already consenting right off the bat by
special appearance you're not okay that's it so once you do that you really
shouldn't have to say anything more now you're probably going to they're probably going to ask some questions
trying to throw out some constitutional bear traps to get you to step in and things like that to Prevail so you got
to be careful and listen to every little word they said because they they got trickery down to a Mastery okay they
really do but the main thing is we run our mouth and then we get in trouble but
once you do that if you've already put your documents in and they're a court of record see if they're not a made a court
of record they can throw your documents out they can do ignore them they can say they're frivolous they can do whatever
the hell they want to they're administrating them because they're nothing more than a letter
but once they're a quarter record they're already a settled matter seeed
reped the with the county county publicly published see that's the thing about publicly publishing something once
it's publicly published there's no way to pull it back if you look on this
document steps to take number 11 you must claim your minor
estate it's going to take some time for me to explain
so what does it mean to claim your minor estate yesterday and for those who
weren't here I'm just going to draw it a little bit on the board in
1882 Congress set up the public charitable trust that was an umbrella
trust that's all it is an umbrella trust underneath the public charitable
trust is everybody's cesta QV
trust
it's that's how it's spelled say QV okay it's an individual trust so our
last sentences I think there was 337 million people in the United States
that all had assess the QV trust under the public charitable trust so
again how this nation Works how it's funded off our system of
slavery is this we're born and a ballot sheet is
created there's a debit side and the credit side I'm just going to
write here I'll just write one Mill in here we're bonded for a million what
does that mean on the debit side $1 million is borrowed from the international monetary
fund and it's thrown out into the banks to the public under the public
charitable trust based upon you being
born based upon your birth registration your birth certificate is a
bond Bond it's on bond paper it's got a bank name it's it's got a cusip number
cup number is a number it's an investment control number regulated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission at one of the 12 federal reserve banks you have a bank
account mine starts with a C which means it's in Cleveland
okay I know what my bank routing number is and I know what my bank account
number is which is my cusip number so I know the routing number of
that Federal Reserve Bank c s i
p okay so a million doll loan from the IMF
is sent out into the public and $1 million on the other side
of the balance sheet of United States Treasury bonds are
issued so you became come the full faith and credit of the United States
government part of it anyway one of 337 million others
okay and you become the Creditor on one side and the detor on the
other do you know that's determined by your
status if you claim the status of We the People a stay National you're a
creditor if you're a US citizen you are a
detor that in which one creates One controls we the people created the US
government US Government created the US
citizen okay so our job in life once we turn 18
is to go out there and earn some money and spend it so we buy a
house 200,000 we buy a car or two or three we buy some
utilities and some medical bills and some food all kinds of crap and that goes on the debit side because these
notes in our pockets in our wallets are legal
tender this debt is kept track of by the bean counters of the Department of
fiscal Services via your
w4s your tax returns your 1040s your credit card statements your bank
statements everything he spend kept track of okay and he goes on the debit side now
in the meantime this in initial investment of this $1
million is bundled invested hypothecated sold on the New York Stock Exchange sold
to companies all over the world this gentleman just put his cusub number off
his birth certificate into gmei utility a few minutes ago right before we
started and saw a whole bunch of companies that are buying and selling him under his unique account
number 10,000 10,000 companies okay buying and selling him
right now all this debt is kept track of this investment keeps growing let's
just say it grows to 100 million and you die it goes through
probate this is the death line and they take the money out of this
account and let's just say they take 10 million out and it's now 90
million and they pay off this and now the balance is zero and they pay the loan back to the IMF all the legal
tender they pay back all your debts now get discharged finally
and they pay it all back and now the balance is zero this still has 90 million it now what do they do with it
they just roll it over United States Treasury bonds full faith the credit of the
government it the balance Remains the Same for perpetuity
forever so my dad who died in 1989 I can punch into his cusub numbers companies
are still buying and selling him he's already gone through probate all this side's a zero balance
for him but all the money that's in there stays the same forever but it continues to grow
right do you know what a sweep account is okay if you go into your bank I don't
care Wells Far go down the street and you open a checking account and a savings account at the same time and you
say I want to designate my account my checking account as a sweep
account a sweep account now you go write a check out of
your checking account to your utility company for 97 bucks for your monthly
utility the bank takes a hundred out of your checking
account and throws $3 into your savings account people look at it like a force
savings plan they just round it up take it out
it's kind of what happens here this stays the same forever let's say this
year it makes another 10 million the government sweeps that off
and it funds government it's an off book
fund so if you look at the government's budget about that
much of their budget that little slice of pie comes from all the income taxes
and taxes paid and all the tariffs on goods and services all the rest of this
comes out of people cesta QV trust everyone who's died since 1933 is
currently funding government today now here's part of the problem
right here I'm going to break this down a little bit farther one more step and part of it a big part of it
is collected out of your cusp while you're still
alive how do they do that against it they bring you up on
charges what is a court a court is a bank a court is a post office if you get
indictment at the bottom of the indictment it says a true bill if you don't pay the bill you're brought up on charges you don't pay the charges your
asked to bond if you don't pay the bond your body is held assurity while they steal from your trust your court case
number is a cusp number and it attaches to your main cup number of your birth
certificate and it's a way to get paid from your account and so it's based upon the penal
sum and the net retentions so if the penal sum like you get a felony count of
fraud it's penal sum is 2 million the judge gets
95,000 in net retention or commission the prosecutor gets 50,000
commission they share some of that with the defense attorney and it's a three-way conspiracy to
conspire to arrest you for so they can get paid off a penal sum and they take 2
million 95 and 50 out of your
account okay now another way is they take your kids yesterday I said every
kid is worth 3.3 million they take your kids they take 1 and a half million out of the mother cqv trust they take one
and a half million out of the father's cqv trust right off the top this CEST QV
trust is our minor
estate it was put into place when we were a minor a baby comes out of the
water is tug through the birth canal is docked at the dock by the dock tender the doctor where a bill of ating is
received it's sent with a tug out to sea presumed dead lost to Sea until it returns to claim its minor
estate after the soul print has been taken they take the soul plate the
prints Footprints of the baby that's taking its Soul so it's dead and lost and sea they take the
Pena and they take the Soul plate thereby taking the baby's
Soul it's kind of a sick way to think of it but that's how the the original cesta
QV Act of 1666 in England was
developed the sustic QV act in England was written in
1666 coincidence doubt it we adopted in
1933 almost 300 years later this is our minor estate we must lay claim to it now
the problem is most of the time we go to court we're going to these lower courts that don't mean didly squat that really
don't have really any authority to rule over us except they say they do and we
consent okay and we go into them and they can't really do anything about this
anyway so what we're doing is we're just putting them on notice that we claim our minor estate we take ownership of our
birth certificates we do that through the Deeds of reconveyance there's other ways to do it
too you can take your birth certificate write a declaration claiming the
ownership and filing that on the land good thing to do notify them so
every time we write a court document when we write our notice of appearance which should be the very first document
that goes into any court case telling them how we're going to appear what our status is how we've taken
Dominion we're just showing up to settle the matter in that document we should always
put in a claim to the minor
estate now they can't do anything about
it but it's putting them on notice that we're claiming it okay
your documents become a quarter record when they're properly served publicly published and filed always do everything
in writing back it up with your words see the only thing you should have to say
out of your mouth is I'm here by special appearance calling for a constitutional Court of
record asking for a summary judgment of the truth and fact placed upon the record by my court of record my documents
and then you should shut up see here's one of the problems almost
always in the story of a mother which you guys missed yesterday
too the story of a mother I'm going to hit it really fast a mother 9 months pregnant walks
into a foundling hospital the legal definition the word foundling is a safe place to abandon a child all hospitals
police stations fire stations and churches in the United States were designated as family so you can walk in
with a baby set it down on the floor smile walk out with no consequences
none all hospitals were designated that so you go into the birthing Ward become
a w of the state that's what you do you walk into the birthing Ward you
deliver the baby out of the water becomes a vessel it gets registered you're handed a stack of paperwork to
fill out and in the nurses manual it says this is just to register your baby with the state and give it a name that's
a quote right out of the nurse's manuals nobody's Securities license nobody's insurance license nobody's
given you a perspectus nobody's told you the terms and conditions of the contract the mother's under duress she's under
the influence of painkillers she's not legally able to even sign a contract and
she signs that fills that paperwork out and signs as an informant the legal defition the word
informant is someone who give someone else up to another thereby giving title and Equity of the child to the state it
forms the doctrine of parents patre where the state is the parent you see how sick and wrong this
really is then CPS can kick down your door with a police officer take your kid run you
through a bunch of Hoops terminate your parental rights do whatever the state wants them to do and then sell your
child and they do it all the time see under the public charitable trust act
you are the co-trustee co- beneficiary and the only
signatory officer this is why it takes three signatures to put a person in jail this
why I explained this yesterday it takes the judges it takes prosecutors and it takes either yours or
your attorneys that's why you don't get power
of attorney to an attorney because he'll sign you away he'll sign you in jail as
shy for the bond most every single time bang head
here seriously well of course but what is the
definition of an attorney an actor to a turn an actor gets up on stage and lies
convincingly enough to make you believe in the character and the plot and to ATT turn is to steal from one and turn over to another therefore a thief so they're
a liar and a thief that's why God warned us in the Bible so what is the legal definition of the word legal the undoing
of God's laws what is legal is not
lawful so why I read doctrine of covenants 98 yesterday I went right
through it it clearly states follow the laws of the land which are
constitutional anything more or less of this cometh of evil the laws of
man and it's clear crystal clear in there so you claim your minor estate now
that's in 99% of your core cases that you're dealing with right here in the state but what happens if you're dealing
in a federal case guess who has the
authority to deal with the Department of fiscal Services which are the
accountants for the United States Treasury which is the holding account of
the cqv trust for the international monetary fund and the Federal
Reserve guess who has that Authority Mary the head CK quirk in that
District Mary has the authority she can fill out the online forms with the
Department of fiscal Services now she needs a a judge and a
prosecutor and your signature or your attorneys to sign off on it now guess
what if I walk in and I make a claim to my minor estate to a federal probate
judge or a bankruptcy
judge federal bankruptcy judge he can order Mary
with my signature to claim the minor
estate there's forms they can fill out with the Department of fiscal services online to put in a claim to my minor
estate I have the count number I have the bank I have the routing number I
have all the information to give to her now you go in there and claim it are they going to try to
stop do they not want you to have access they can't stop you were the co- trustee
co- beneficiary and the only signatory officer this is just an administrative
process well prior to 1999 November of 1999 the United States
declared bankruptcy prior to that I'd claimed my minor estate and I had a black credit
card in my pocket I could could buy a lar jet on okay you did that no I didn't buy a
lar jet yeah I had a black credit card on my
account link to your minor linked to my estate at the Federal Reserve the bank in
Cleveland with my account number the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland now in
that November 99 the United States declared bankruptcy and they attached
all the the QV trust to the federal debt the 25 trillion or whatever is in
debt right so now I know a few people who have claimed their minor estate
since then and it's really funny that when that paperwork the day that paperwork goes in the debt clock goes
and drops 150,000 or
so there portion of the federal debt got paid off when they claimed their minor
estate so ITA so we could go wipe out a whole 25 trillion off it only takes about 150,000 out of our you know 100
million that you might have in there and you're entitled to half of that money you're the co- trustee the
co-beneficiary the only signatory officer if there's a 100 million in there 50 million of it's yours
now they have been very very good money managers I don't recommend taking it out
I recommend just asking for Access and having a checking account on it with a
credit card now you want to go buy a house go down to Wells Fargo and say hey
I like that house over there it's worth 300,000 just put it on this
to yeah same with that new Chevy durax diesel truck put that 75,000 on this if
I walk into a Chevy dealership I happen to like durmax diesels I like the crew cab long bed
fully Decked Out LTZ 75 $80,000 trucks right if I walk in
there with $80,000 or whatever it is and I lay it down on a table at that moment
in time I own that truck but the salesman looks at me and says give me another $250 for title
license registration please I say no that's okay I'm going buy it to export
to a foreign country and then he gives me the MCO and
MSO after I sign a little statement that I'm buying to export it and then I get in the truck and I sit down I roll the
seats back I turn the key and I drive out of the dealership and when I land on
the road I'm exporting it from the state of Oregon to
Oregon a foreign Nation I own the truck as a man it's private for-profit entity
I'm not going to use it as an Uber now if I wanted to use one as an Uber I could file it under my vessel
name in international Commerce but then I'd have to license it with the state hey I've walked into Federal cour houses
and I I've done this here I want to open a federal case under miscellaneous case number here's
my $400 I'm going to be filing paperwork later we'll convert it into a civil or criminal
case and I walk out's they just open a case number they give me a cusip number under a
miscellaneous filing for me to do something with
later and that would be another cive number added to your cive number no it's a cive number that I can do something
with I control that so now I can attach that
to my birth certificate number and I can use that to claim my minor
estate by calling for a probate judge to adjudicate
it and then Mary has to contact the bean counters and find out how much I owe on the debit
side and how much I have on the credit side and that all goes through that
Probate Judge who pays off all all the all the
debts and then whatever is left I claim half because half's mine but I don't
want to take it you just want to keep letting they're good investment managers they've proven themselves to be good
investment managers leave it there what if I get in trouble sometime and I needed something to draw on now I now I
just walk into court and I settle the matter here's my birthday certificate here's my cusa here here's my credit
card let's settle the matter what's the penal sum see if then if I get indicted see here's the problem with an
indictment everybody gets an indictment it's got a penal sum it says
right at the bottom is a true bill which means it's an invoice and nobody bothers to say well how much is the
bill and they don't ask so third three days later they're brought up on
charges because they didn't ask how much the bill and they didn't settle the matter you got the opportunity to settle
on the matter at the indictment before anything else occurs but you don't it's
like getting a credit card bill pin it on the fridge and I'll pay it later and you forget about it
right how much would an indictment be sets that number what are you being
charged with what how what what crime did they put on the invoice is it fraud
a federal Cas felony of fraud is $2 million penal sum I know that because I
fought one of those cases four felon CS of fraud 8 million bucks so you'd have to go in there and pay two million bucks
that's right so you just hand your credit card has got 100 million in your
account let's take care of that right now settle the
matter if you committed the crime you have the option of fighting
it you can say I'm I decare my innocence I'm not going to pay it I'm declaring my innocence let's go to trial I think I
can convince a jury I can walk in and establish my status my standing my jurisdictions and I don't think I'm
going to lose fine or you can say these guys are making $10 million a
month on my account what's 2 m no hassle no problem I don't have to
go to court maybe it's worth two mil if You' got 50 mil in the bank again you
see what I mean the only reason why you could be found or in trouble is if you committed murder or something so it's
not and other than that I have limited diplomatic Community as a state National read the Geneva conventions we the
people the state Nationals have limited diploma of community as for the Geneva conventions both of them sure it is but
who cares it's a civil matter it's just a bill it's just an invoice they can't
hold your body assurity no sweat off your brow no time in jail no three Hots
in a cot no blood off your hands you know if if the money doesn't matter that
much they're being good money managers and manag in your account if I know they're going to make $10 million next
month what's two let them have it let them fund government I'm not going to pay any
income tax not going to pay any property tax because my land's in land patent I'm
not going to pay him any fees at the DMV we are supposed to pay for 19
governmental Services now this is a great way to do it see it's all on how you look at
things it's right here is how you look at it it's just an invoice just pay it
like you would your light bill by the way you can use a credit card for your light bill too 90% of the reason you get
in trouble is because you're say too much okay you be at peace you take
control you have authority it's how the FBI operates the only way they have
authority is they wear the suit they walk in and they intimidate
everybody we're taking over that's right we're taking
over they don't even have any Congressional authority to even exist no corporate charter none we the people can
run for office and when we walk in the door of our office I'm a state
citizen when I walk out the door of my office and go home I'm a State national
we the people created government we run our government when we serve each
other the people I'm a citizen I'm an employee of government what you violate
that when I walk in with an neon's violation is the only way you can violate that that means I step outside
of my scope and authority and then you as another State national can hold me
accountable as a state citizen not another
citizen we have to hold you have to hold me accountable as a stasis it's we the
people's job to self-govern to watch our elected public
officials and to call them out for the things they do wrong what did I tell you our two jobs were yesterday we only have
two jobs in life that's it correct the errors our public servants make and to
educate them so they don't do it again that's it the rest of time we could be fishing camping hunting riding
motorcycles whatever you want to do well yesterday they arrested Millie uh
uh Milly weav thank you Millie Weaver can think her last name just went through my head yesterday showed up at
her house right in front of her kids arrest her they didn't have a warrant they didn't have their indictment they didn't have nothing and she just went
with them I wouldn't even opened the freaking door scar I would have told him to get
the hell off the property and quit trespassing against me if you want to talk to me you come back with a warrant
that warrant and I'm going to tell it to them like this it better be from an article one or an article three core it
better have a raise Court seal it better have a wedding signature of a judge it better be backed up by a claim or
affidavits or testimony sworn under the penalty of perjury that I did something wrong and then I'll go answer for
it but if not it ain't worth the paper it's written on and I'm going to light it on fire right at your feet and I will
I'll whip out a cigarette lighter and I'll light it on fire and I'll drop it right in front of me and say come back
when you have a real warrant because if a warrant isn't backed up by a claim and affidavit or
sworn testimony it's not a real warrant if it doesn't have a raised Court seal
it's not a real warrant these faxed over I got a case in Montana an FBI
signed a agent signed the judge's name on it I have the judge's signature I can
look at the two and go not even close right this is what we got to do we
got to have some knowledge so that we know what to say is this also where your
castle doctrine so that you can does have absolutely that's what I'm thinking
is they can't just come in and take you away since governments have chosen to incorporate themselves they must follow
the same rules as any other corporation that is right out of a Supreme Court case so are you telling me a guy wearing
a Walmart t-shirt can show up at my house and throw me in
jail neither can the police officer from the city of Riverton he's a private
for-profit entity he's not government he's deao he's acting as a
governmental Services Corporation as a lawful agent no no a legal agent legal
he's not lawful he's acting as a legal agent a
legal agent is unlawful which should be color of law it's color of law so under
Title 18 section 242 he's depriving me of my rights under the color of law you
can't do that sorry buddy title Title 18 section 242 if two
or more come let's just say he comes with a CPS agent to take my kids
if two or more come it's title two 241 it's a conspiracy to deprive me of
my rights under the color law he can't do that either I love the US
code I could probably come up with 130 codes on average that are all felonies
that all carry a quarter of a million dollar fine in one to 10 years in prison per count of crimes that they're
committing coming over to talk to
me I'm saying make it your friend sleep with that puppy Okay read it every
waking moment you got until you learn it because the United States code was put there for one reason one reason only
that's for We the People to hold our public servants accountable it's not for them to hold you accountable the only
reason they do is because you claim to be a citizen so you're one of them
you just made yourself one of
them what's that a lot okay let's talk about that for just
a minute you look at title 26 of the United States code that's the Internal Revenue Service Code you guys want to
learn something about taxes for a second in title 26 of the United States
code it says no part of this title not its headings nor its body nor its
footnotes nor its definitions shall be construed as
law wait did you hear what I said all right I'll say it again in title 26 it says no
part of this title not its headings nor its body nor its footnotes nor its
definitions shall be construed as law that's the IRS
code soone of it sure is they send you a letter and
you comply they you they say you must fill out this 1040 form and you believe them
and you sign it and you send it
in thanks for the gift thanks for the gift State national read the books written by
former heads of the IRS it's funny in every book written by every former head of the IRS and every one of them writes
a book you can buy them at Barnes & Noles okay they say we're not really
sure why anyone pays the income or wage tax because what was a 1040 Abraham
Lincoln put the 1040 bonds made them available during the Civil War so that
people could to support the troops support the war efforts and gift money to the government to fund the
war and we just never quit gifting rather than borrow it yeah rather than
borrow it so we just never quit gifting I talked about this yesterday
but you it's okay you notify the IRS through a form 56 of what
you are your status under title 26 the IRS code which
isn't law there's a definition in there that you can claim to be a foreign estate
Andor trust well here's an interesting paragraph It's not what I was looking at but it's it's pretty interesting in 1979
edition of the 22 usca 278 the United Nations you will find executive order
10422 the office of personnel management is under the direction of the secretary of the United Nations pursu into
treasury delegation order number 991 the IRS entered a service agreement with the United States Treasury Department as
their collection agency C Public Law 94564 legislative history page
5,967 reorganization bankruptcy plan number 26 in the agency for
International Development this is what talks about our federal government being under
bankruptcy being under being under the jurisdiction of the army under the Army Field
Manual Field Manual the Army Field Manual um and at that time it was from
1969 Army Field Manual
but it shows that the IRS is an agency member of the 169 at that time Nations
pack called the international crime police organization or Interpol oh wow
that's found at 22 usca 263a the memorandum of understanding
between the Secretary of Treasury ekka the corporate governor of the fund
and the bank which is the international monetary fund and the International Bank for reconstruction and development so
that's the fund name and the bank name indicated that the attorney general
and his associates are soliciting and collecting information for foreign
principles the international organizations corporations and Associates exemplified by 22 USC 286
F this document that I'm looking at right now this is my affidavit
repudiation I wrote this document and the majority of this
document having been changed to fit the person that I gave it to printed it he's
a jur doctorate his name is Melvin Stamper and he and I work together on
his book fruit from a poisonous tree which has been a New York Times bestseller it's in been used in just
about every courtroom is set the doctrine of fruit from a poisonous tree
and my affidavit P chapter two of his book pretty much okay
so these are uh this affidavit has probably been put in by about 40,000
people so it's got to fit you it's got to be
yours anytime you take anyone's document as I said yesterday and you make it yours it has
to fit your situation otherwise you're committing a felony under the penalty of
perjury did you know the US adopted the common La of England with the
Constitution anybody know that okay not all right here's what I was looking
for 26 USC
7701 a31 is a tax exempt forign estate and or
trust so what I do is I use a form 56 I notify the IRS that I
am under that title of their code which isn't
law but they go by it doesn't apply to me but they go by it and that notifies
them that that's what I am and then if I wanted to go work at an employer when I went to their HR department I would fill
out a Wen W8 B en instead of a
W4 okay now what is that and under the
w8ben I'm tax exempt so I get 100% of my paycheck you
have to file your status first to yes you do and then you don't have to file a
1040 or anything else because you're tax exempt forign State and or trust and
they know it it's on record claim mindor estate that's what all this has been
about and I think we can all do
it just go do it I know a lady in California that has had a case going in
federal court and she heard one of my talks somewhere where I talked about this she I didn't even know her from
Adam she got it off the internet right she went into a court in California in a
federal court case and she stood up and and claimed her minor account she
appointed the court clerk as a trustee of her account she authorized the court
clerk by her signature to hire any professionals that she may need
necessary such as a probate judge or a bankruptcy judge to claim her minor estate and she
asked for half she walked out of the courtroom with a chck for $45 million oh my
God that's after they settled it all our debts and everything $45 million she got
a check I wouldn't recommend that I recommend let them manage it
yeah they're going to keep on adding more to oh they they they have the ability to
hypothecate and that's a rare wonderful thing I wish I could hypothecate all my
investments I'll put it this way I know a guy that took a $100 million and he hypothecated it and in 10 days it was
worth 1.2 billion good job if you can get it
there's only a few people in the world allowed to do that one of them is the federal government it's to bundle and sell and bond in advance I don't know
the whole ins and outs of the whole thing but they bundle sell and bond in advance and they sell
it very quickly like they'll trade it every few minutes on the stock exchange
and ju it just turns into more more more more more and more money all the time
and they can do it really fast yeah it's crazy this is the
person that has the access there's 12 Federal districts there's one head Court
Clerk at each district that's 12 people who have hundreds of Court quirks
underneath them but takes her signature to access the department of
fiscal services website do we have one here in Salt Lake nope so we have to go
to thatt like you're talking about going to the well you do have a federal court
here so I guess my statement wasn't really true because the Ninth District has
multiple federal courts but I know Mary is ahead of the entire 9th
District so we don't have to specifically go where Mary no I I bet you you could go just to the federal
court building here and talk to the Head Court Clerk but you're going to have to
open up a case that's 400 bucks I think is what they charge now to open a
miscellaneous case and then go home once you open it and you got the cusa number because you
want to have it open first right then you have that number now you take that number home and you do your documents
and you put that number on your documents and you go back and say convert this to a civil matter a probate
matter a civil probate matter now she assigns a probate judge to
it right and now you're just asking him with a motion to move the court
for a decision on this probate to settle the probate
you got get your account number if if you're older like me on the back of my social security number has my bank and
routing number and then on my birth certificate it has my cusip
number if you want to have more fun go find a stock broker one of these you
know Wells Fargo uh uh that special bank that they have what do they call that
the wells cargo Investment Services or something where all the Brokers are go make friends with one of those guys and
say here here's my number off my birth certificate here's my social security number here's my driver's license here's
my military ID here's my Advanced degree in college number can you look up the main cusp number and
match all these and show all the accounts on one spreadsheet yes and then you have that
take that and attach it to your legal document take it into I got
do son-in-law okay see there you go those guys can look it up but because
they're a broker they get to log into it used to be I could anybody could just
log into Fidelity and do this okay but now they've kind of separated their
website into broker only information and general public information so now it
takes a broker to really look up the good stuff two sides of the coin right now you got
good and evil you got Trump you got the Deep
State this includes the the world one world order
the UN the United Nations the Council on for relations the IMF the I mean I go on
and on and on all right so you got these people and then you got we the
people over here we have been for a while we're not now okay and he so you
got this side and you got this side so right now president Trump and we the
people are trying to get rid of the IRS we're trying to get rid of the
who we're trying to get rid of the United Nations we're trying get rid of
on and on and on and on and on right we're trying to stop all this most of these people are in business to traffic
people and children that's that do you understand that that's their whole M Mo
and it has been forever since
1666 huh maybe even before that but what I'm
saying is that's when they made it all legal okay to traffic everything is
about trafficking everything is about trafficking you and you and you and you and you and
our kids the problem is the kids they exploit
right so we're trying to get rid of all this and we're trying to bankrupt
them that's really the only way you can get that's the easiest way and Trump knows that it's why he doesn't care care
if he sends 3 million to China or 5 million to Russia or he doesn't care
let's spend all these Federal Reserve notes we can and you know what the United Nations is saying right now God
we're almost bankrupt they're coming out and saying it crying they're
crying all these governments and if you look at Trump's first year in office he met with over 30
prominent world leaders to help him with this plan do you know even Iran he took the
sword of Iran Iran is under President Trump it's
control do you know the North Korea gave Trump control isn't a new
world no it's to dissolve the New World Order the Deep States been in there
running those guys yeah deep States been running all that communism's been run I
said this yesterday what's happening in China right now breaks my heart I have

we'd like to be Sovereign no longer Communists they're tired of over 20
countries have pulled out of the United Nations and and and declared their
sovereignty 20 countries doesn't Bolivia Bulgaria
Iceland China wanted to Mongolia did quite a few countries
have declared their sovereignty un united states be nice if
we did really soon okay we're supposed to already be but there's not enough State Nationals once you're a State
national you're a sovereign okay as you're as long as you're a US citizen you're a
slave you're not the king unless you claimed your status State Department just made an
announcement a week or so ago that said they're getting getting more applications than they've ever seen for
State Nationals ppeo Mike Pompeo said that now the coin coin shortage is
because president Trump took our coinage back see he says things like I Donald J
Trump as president of the United States of America do hereby take back the coinage of the United
States what did he just do when he said that he did the same thing with our utility companies he changed jurisic
itions on him he took it back on behalf of we the people he told me June 22nd of
2019 that he's restored the Republic and now it's up to me you looked me right in
the eye and said that I want you to do it my job is to train the trainers by the way not teach the students that's
why right now right he taking back the coinage from them that's why we're having coin shortage Wells Fargo is a
Federal Reserve banking affiliate he can't get coins from the
Federal Reserve the only ones they're getting in is the ones we the people are walking in with and turning in I recommend don't
turn any in right now put them in a piggy bank save them for a little while okay it's not that they're going to be
worth anymore it's just that they're not going to be given to them see the trick is what's what the plan is is we
take we take all these Federal Reserve notes notes out of our
pockets and we take these things because these are just legal
tender they're not worth the paper they're written on and what president Trump's trying to
do is he's printing a whole bunch of United States notes that are backed by the gold and silver held by the London
Havard trust and he's back going to be once we
have enough of them printed which has been a chore should have been done a year ago about a year behind
schedule but you take those things and you put them on all the armored car
warehouses and then the armored cars show up and they load the federal the US notes onto the car they drive to the
bank on a Friday and they put them in the vault and they take all these things
and they take them out of the Vault and they put them back in the armor car and they ship them to the Federal Reserve and when load after load after load of
these things show up at the Federal Reserve Banks president Trump will give them a call and say use that to pay off
our national debt and all of the mortgages and all the student
loans everything backed by the federal government pay it all
off see they they ensure all the mortgages they ensure all the student
loans and this is what people don't understand about your change all of your notes are backed by
the Federal Reserve which is nothing the change is backed by the treasury that's
right it's co our coinage it's the United States of America it's always going to be worth something it's never
going to lose its value change will never lose its value okay history repeats itself right okay so you
remember what here here's what happened 1912
1913 they created the Federal Reserve they created the fiat currency jaal
Island happened a few years before okay they created these acts between
1905 and 1933 they created a whole bunch of Acts of Congress that set up this
whole money scheme and fraud scheme period that's when the majority of bad
things happen now actually Lincoln started the pro problem and set up a few things and on and on and on there was
some before 1905 but between 1905 1905 1908 is when the church became
a 501c3 and sold out the federal government as well okay
now between 1908 and 1933 these are when the acts of Congress
you want to learn a lot of history just read all the acts read the Congressional records from all those those
years and you'll see if you can pick out the pieces of the puzzle in there this
system of frud this is how I've done it this is how I'm able to stand in front of you and tell you all this stuff
because I pull I'm really good at puzzles and I can see a piece from a
mile away and I grab this piece here and I grab this piece over here and I grab this piece here and I put it all
together because they burnt the box top and that's the only way we can see the picture of the fraud right
so they put in this Federal Reserve package then we
had they released a whole bunch of paper dollars into the public charitable trust
between 1908 and 1922 and then we had the Roaring 20s and
everybody was making more money than they' ever had it stimulated the economy people were singing and dancing and
going to clubs and drinking we whiskey and all this stuff the Roaring 20s and
they were spending money that they' never had before so they were going into debt they were buying new homes they
were good first mortgages were during that period of time before that people
paid cash for their house or they homesteaded now they're in the mortgage and they're going into debt and they're
doing all this in the Roaring 20s and then what did the Federal Reserve do
they said oh now that we've done this we can collapse it and here comes the Great
Depression and they collapsed the whole thing and then they went back and bought all those houses for 50 cents on the
dollar or 10 cents on and nickel on the dollar in a lot of cases they bought up all these businesses people jumped out
of Windows that committed suicide in New York and Chicago and any tall building they could jump out the window of
because it destroyed their families this was a planned event from 1908 okay to release all the this money
then to collapse it then what did they do 1933 stepped in with the new deal
they set up the Social Security program they made all you citizens they set up the cesta QV trust and they did more
than that They confiscated all of my grandfather's gold
he was a geologist for the State of California and they took over a million in gold from him at $20 an ounce do you
know it's 2,000 plus announced right now do you know what had happen if I he would have passed that down to me right
now what I'd be worth they took over a million bucks from
him okay
yeah I'd be a billionaire one
swoop yeah so here's the issue they did this they manufactured factured this they
developed the plan okay this is a poster that was drawn up by Mr
Aldrich and his buddy kroer they call it the octopus it's the
Aldrich plan this was what they presented at the on jaal island the
meeting of the bankers that set up the whole Federal
Reserve can you see that do you know it's spoken of in the Bible the monster
that rises up out of the sea and okay this was the start of the downfall okay
seen that all right evil rarely looks evil until it accomplishes its goal it
gains entrance by appearing attractive desirable and perfectly legitimate it is
a baited and camouflaged trap it's a good quote Edward mandle
house was a uh he he was not a public servant he never served one day in
government but he had the ear of several
presidents including being a chief private advisor to Woodrow
Wilson okay prior to 1912 woodro Wilson quoted since I
entered politics I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately some of the biggest men in the
United States in the field of Commerce and Manufacturing are afraid of
somebody they are afraid of something they know that there is a power somewhere so organized so subtile
so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they had better not
speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it or fear for their
lives they were talking about the Illuminati quar back then okay now in
1921 in his final speech as president he said I am a most unhappy man I have
unwittingly ruined my country a great industrial nation is now controlled by
its system of credit we are no longer a government by free opinion no longer a
government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of
Domin men that was his final speech a quote
out of his final speech as pres okay why did he quote that
okay in a meeting in the Oval Office with woodro Wilson and Edward mandle
house Edward mandle house said this now Edward mandle house was the one
that gathered the bankers together on jaal island he was a Texas oil
billionaire okay and he had the year of several presidents because of his wealth and he said
this very soon every American will be required to register their biological
property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that
will operate under the ancient system of pledging your children I pledge
allegiance to the flag right by such methodology we can compel
people to submit to our agenda which will affect our security as a chargeback
for our Fiat paper currency every American will be forced to register or
suffer being a unable to work and earn a living they will be our chatt and we
will hold the security interest over them Forever by operation of the law Merchant under the scheme of secured
transactions of Americans by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of
leading the birth certificates to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent
forever to remain economic slaves through taxation secured by their pledges they will be stripped of their
rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they
will be none the wiser for not one man in a million could ever figure out our plans
if by accident one or two should figure it out we have in our Arsenal plausible
deniability after all this is the only logical way to fund government by
floating leans and debts to the registrant register your birth
certificates register your cars register your kids on and on in the form of benefits and
privileges this will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest EXP
expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call social
insurance became a Social Security Act without realizing it every American will
ensure us for any loss we may incure and in this manner every American will unknowingly be our servant however
begrudgingly the people will become helpless and without any hope for their Redemption and we will employ the high
Office of the President of our dummy Corporation to foment this plot against America who wrote this again this was a
speech the talk of Edward mle House to President Wilson woodro
Wilson he kind of lays it out right there right the whole system of the
fraud sure as hell should be if sedition if nothing
else they do it under the 19 197 War Powers Act the the trading with the
Enemy act the the crash of 1929 this security of
our gold here's our the three flags we have
the flag of Peace the flag of War and the captured flag me the flag captured
flag has gold Fringe around it I thought that was admiralty flag is what I read Maritime flag lost at se
admiralty flag is a captured flag when the Pirates would capture another ship they would pull their flag down sew a
fringe around it hang it up underneath their flag on their ship saying that
they captured this ship and they just hope to fill up their flag pole with captured flags and that's exactly what
the bar association did US yes they displayed in every courtroom as a
captured war flag that's why it's in the courtrooms yes
it's called Inland piracy the Shephard toer maternity Act created the birth
registration known as the birth certificate okay yeah shepher town or
maternity act I mean I can go back to all the acts of Congress has set up this
whole system of fraud it was done precept upon precept and it set it all
up between 1900 and 1904 there's a set of cases called called the insular
tariff cases those cases Were A S series of Supreme Court cases that gave
congress permission to create a separate nation using the federal territories and
possessions of States like Guam Puerto Rico American Samo and others became a
union of States known as the United States of America minor from then on Congress re began referring to this
entity as if it was referring to the Continental United States ah see they
used the Supreme Court to set up all of our US
territories as a United States of America minor and then they started referring it
and this is how they took away our desure government of the United States of America and made it de
facto and they just used it a little at the time so who ran the Supreme Court
Bar Association they've stole this country we the people
are at war with the bar I keep saying that over and over and over again they control everything any one
thing I want you to study besides the United States code is I want you to study a case called hail versus
hankle you should have heard it it's been upheld more than 1,600 times but
there's no other case in history that EXP explains our status as well as that an individual St
State citizen which is a State national who's in office
right has unalienable constitutional rights while US citizen a creature of
the state has Privileges and civil rights and is held subject to all
policies rules codes and statutes the same as any other public servant upheld over 16 00 Times by both the district
and the Supreme Courts that one paragraph out of that
case pretty much explains what you need to know why is
anybody claiming to be a United States citizen I don't know I can't figure it out that's self-induced slavery just by
making that claim a legal person equals a legal fiction which equals a US
citizen okay one of the terms used predominantly by the present civil governments and courts
in America is legal person just what is a legal person here are its definitions
a a legal person is a body of persons or an entity considered as a corporation is
having many of the rights and responsibilities of a natural person and especially the capacity to
Sue and be sued see they can't really sue a State national
but the US citizen they can sue them
okay yeah anyway I could read that whole page but you get past that there's no
sense so it's a State national you don't sue you claim you claim if I go out here
in the car and I go to a stop sign and I get hit by a driver while I'm stopped
it's his fault obviously I get his name his address address and his insurance company and
his policy number I contact my insurance company and I say hey this guy's at
fault I'm putting in a claim here's his policy number go sue his insurance
company I don't sue the driver I make a claim and I sue his insurance company so
when we make a claim all these City agencies and what have you these
corporations are all Bond and insured we just sued the state of
Montana we sued moo we sued their insurance company if they're bonded for
5 million I'm going to sue them for
4,995,000 and they got a $5 million Bond they're going to find some way to make
it so I lose they will yes but if they're covered we can go right up to the
maximum amount of their policy see so then the insurance company does
exactly what they did in Montana they went to the sheriff who was beating people up and violating their
constitutional rights we sued the insurance company for 5 million bucks
which was a sheriff's in limit on his insurance and then the insurance company goes over to
the sheriff and says hey you knock that off you keep violating their constitutional rights we're going to
drop our policy you you're going to be liable on your own and the sheriff's
going well I ain't losing my house okay I'll knock it off you see let the insurance company
put them in the line it's a great way to do it done in
Brad street numbers I as I'm scanning through this old presentation I probably haven't looked at in a year I wrote it
like 10 years ago is all the D Brad street numbers the United States government's a0 5 27141
96 okay the US Department of Justice is 011 669 674 Department of treasures
02666 oh that's interesting 02666
1067 Department of the treasury yeah wow anyway I got page after page of them
here you want to know States I got how you even have the national aeronomics and space administrations NASA's and US
Food and Drug Administration is 13818 2175 and we're suing them right
now she's been acting as one of my pargal and doing things for me over the
last year and I have a few of those around the country one of them's a judge she
acts as paralegal sometimes and so can handle some of this
stuff but uh here uh let me go to the state of
Utah state of Utah 00909 431 or
4301 the city of Salt Lake City is 01709
6780 which one state of Utah
009 0943
01 city of Salt Lake City
01709 6780 so after lunch we're going to talk
about know thy enemyand patents on a condominium how do you can you do that since it's a shared
space if you canide your meats and Bounds down the middle of that wall yeah
okay so it's really about this the walls of where your space is okay condos are
tough okay I I actually own a condo in downtown Ben that I bought for my
mother-in-law a long time ago the problem is they're stacked this
way right so I can't claim the land patent under it because then I affect the people
above me and the people above that so some condos are stacked this way
and if you've got a perfect meets and Bounds that divides the wall you could probably claim it okay the problem with
condos is a lot of times there's a you got all kinds of people controlling
things yeah homeowners associations condo associations okay they're a pain in the
house okay sell it buy a house okay
thanks okay I was reviewing the steps to take dominion over all jurisdictions and
on um number nine your business on land should be a PMA private member
Association or as a trading company I recommend a PMA um so I have an LLC is
that hard to change that's on to um PMA can you explain converted I don't know
how to do that I'm a baby business owner you can dissolve an LLC or a corporation and and rewrite the whole thing as a PMA
move all the assets into it do it through a trust do it through a private membership Association make all your
members a part of it the reason there it gives you two options there is depending
on the nature of the business some businesses are pretty hard
to uh claim as a
PMA you remember Route 66 the old Route 66 it went from California to Chicago if
you drive outout 66 you'll see all these old businesses with the signs still up
there that says so and so Trading Company so and so Trading Company so and so Trading
Company when the whole Federal Reserve stuff
started in about 192 12 and it took him a while to really put
everything into place to make this happen but people were sold during that
period of time on getting rid of their trading
companies and limiting their liability by doing an LLC or a corporation pretty much
registering it with the state they were sold a bill of goods bunch of hoo-ha really
and they would have been better off keeping their trading companies okay but that's why we had
trading companies because we were free as free men everybody was a State national back
then we were free to trade with anyone we wanted any other state National we could barter we could trade
most of our money back then was gold and silver it was real money
and therefore four trading companies okay gold and silver being
real money what is real money real money is the same as anything else it's the same as a commodity it's the same as a
feather if you need feathers and I have feathers I can trade her for eggs or
something I need right gold and silver is the same way it's just an interim exchange if you
remember in the Bible King Solomon King David okay King Solomon was the son of
King David his people loved him King Solomon's lands controlled the world
worldwide King Solomon was blessed with the ability to walk across the soil of
our land and he could feel the minerals in the earth beneath him and he'd say
dig here there's gold dig here there's there's silver dig here there's diamonds rubies whatever he was blessed with that
ability King Solomon's Minds weren't in one location in Africa as the old 1930s
movie said it was okay they were all over the world the Philippines had
tremendous amount of gold there were 17 caves were filled with it in the
Philippines okay New Zealand tons of gold New Zealand 1769 they put that gold
on deposit with the King of England the King of New Zealand the
mayores put the gold on deposit with the King to hold in trust for the people in
New Zealand and then they did Timber contracts and sold them Timber and all
every it became a mess because once the World Bank got their whole hand on it they didn't want to give it back once
the queen got her hold on it she didn't want to give it back back see so the mayori have
been King George watin tutari right now who exists right now it's 50 years old
he grew up in a shanty town he's a king he is worth hundreds of millions of
dollars in gold and his family's Crest is stamped on the back of these gold bars sitting in
Europe and they won't give it to him what's his name King George wtin
tutari okay so you got the mayores the Maes the
Hawaiians do you know all the islands of the Pacific all the
kings the king of Hawaii before the United States took Hawaii and stole it
from them all those kings of those islands were 12 sons under the king of mayori in
1769 and the King when he died he gave Polynesia and Easter Islands and the
Cook Islands and Hawaiian islands and he gave them to each one of his sons to be
a king of and then we came in later and took it took the lands from the
King but they were 12 sons all
mayori little history
anyone else could you please spell dun and Brad
number I'm not sure how to even spell that Dunn and Brad street is that what it is D you're looking for the website
just spell the D DNN it's a credit bureau like
Transunion and Experian are for us dun brry is a credit bureau for all corporations and so D dun is DN and then
what's Brad street just b r a d r Street okay and then um what's the least amount
of pages you've ever seen on an Affidavit of repudiation because I'm looking at your 32 page and I'm overwhelmed I'm like three four three or
four it doesn't have to be 32 pages okay sh I've done Alid was over 99 Pages kept
it under 100 okay okay and then how much time will steps 1 through 11 that we
went over today like that affidavit and like the uh passport how how much time would that take an average woman would
you say that's really to doing all this what the hell is an average woman I
have never met one of those animals well I mean maybe not so average
then you might get it done in two weeks and it might take her four months who knows I mean there's no such thing as an
average woman by the way well I'm hoping that I can get all this done within a year or less that's a tough species just
for me to figure out I know we are well you might have a better answer
for than I do um last question last kind I have two more questions can I get an
email of all your PowerPoints just so I can study them I want to be a teacher you got to do is email me and ask okay
and what steps would for safety would you suggest people who talk about this stuff online vocally have which is there
any for safety yeah I guess I mean just do it I'm like Nike just do it all
right you know it really depends on you and your employe myself then don't worry about it you got
yourself permission um some employers don't like
you talking about things online on your social media that's where the real
danger lies and losing your job if you learn this stuff you could probably tell them where to go how to
get there so my husband taking uh uh out his
401k and they said he's doing it now because they said he have three years to pay the taxes with because of the covid
but is there a way if he hasn't I mean to not pay those taxes back with what
you're say you're talking about back taxes right now the 401K like he's going to take out that
money well okay first of all you deposited a 401K with some corporation
that Corporation is going to decide whether their requirements are that you
they have to withhold from you okay are they going to follow the IRS
law chances are they probably will they'll probably not let you take it all out at once now some want you transfer
it some let you transfer it into gold or silver 401K that's what I would recommend
doing um so his situation right now is she's going to
jump in and answer this he's actually they said he has three years with the the co thing but
he's quitting his job so he's taking out his 401k the whole thing right now
so I know I'm just wondering is he going to have to take right he get he gets he can get a
penalty if if he's still claiming to be a US citizen he's still filing his 1040s if
he's still doing all this I'd recommend sending in a form 56 declaring your
status like I told you to do earlier and then taking it out out and telling them
where to go with it so so do your status first and then absolutely you have
rights but if you don't do your status the reason I talk about status over and over and over again is is the one and most important thing you can do you have
to have status first see okay so if he doesn't have stat first he's pretty much going to
have to pay that well it's his own consent his own detriment is he a
servant servants got to follow the rules
um I'm curious if there's a way that you can mess up this process or go through
this and get into legal trouble somehow I'm assuming you can if you obviously don't
follow the steps to a te or if you don't really know what you're talking about but is there education is important yeah
it's just like driving down the road if you don't know to stop at a stop sign you might get hit yeah it's that simple
learn the rules of the road earn your don't get H yeah learn your don't get hit I
mean it's no different than anything else I mean I could probably give you 300 examples of things you got to learn
to do before you go do them so is it any different being a national mean that you
give up your citizen your your being a US citizen absolutely that's a change of
status so how does that affect getting a gun because through an fft transfer you
have to claim that you have not given up your citizenship that's right you do so
does that mean that you are no longer eligible I got lots of guns and I buy them all the time so do you just not check it and you
can still get it or what G guess what when I go apply for a gun and I fill out
the form mine sails right through within minutes and I walk out at the store with
a gun okay my gun permit started in
1791 1791 the Second Amendment is my concealed carry
permit I can also have any weapon our military has there's no law under the
Constitution that says you have to carry a certain way carry it a
certain way or have a certain kind of firearm or not have a bump stock or have
a magazine that holds 50 rounds there nothing that says you can't have an A10 or an A1 tank okay during our
break somebody reminded me of something so let's just pretend this is a 8 and 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper it's a document
of some kind so what I did forget this stuff up here is I divided it into
thirds to show you which side of the paper and what color ink you sign on so
typically on a commercial contract in the jurisdiction of the water a document
is written in Black Ink and you sign in blue you sign your
signature holding office of a person of Your Vessel you're the signatory
officer okay and you sign on the left hand side
of the page in the jurisdiction of the air a
trust you sign it as a living soul in the center of the page and you
sign in
purple in the jurisdiction of the land you you autograph this is an autograph
too by the way these two are autographs that's a signature you autograph on the
right hand side of the page as a man mankind man or a woman that's owning
property it has to deal with titles and your rights land Equity anything of
equity a security an investment real money gold or silver your car your
household goods anything you own of equity and you want to lay title to
those if you're signing as a man and what if I'm doing a legal document that
declares my sovereignty I'm going to fill it out and
I'm going to sign it just like this on with all three in every jurisdiction and
I'm going to have a seal underneath and I'm going to have it
notorized by three types of notaries I there oh I know see there's a
problem right there too so you got a notary public
in the land you got a notary
republic uhhuh and then you got a notary which is a
jurit notary is a jur notary republic notary
[Music] public gosh half the notaries don't know that and I'm one of them and I don't
know so I can only do one that no you can do all three I can yeah depends on
how you sign your name whether it be a signature whether it be an autograph as
a living soul and whether it be an autograph as a woman as a as a notary and she can note
all three of she can she can the problem is the state stamp she buys from the
state signifies she's probably only one signifies that she may only be one but she can order different
stamps and you can order stamps and make up your own stamps for your name every
one of us should have our own seals raise seals they're important now one
thing about our seals we can make our own seals up we can use our family crest
we can do all kinds of things as long as we are consistent one thing we can do in
the land is we can use a $1 stamp and endorse it sign it over put it under the
postal unit the post office have you seen lately uh like in the last day or
two uh everybody's worried about the United States Postal Service going bankrupt I'm hoping it
does because then the United States Post Office can come back so the United States Post Office is
our desure postal office the United States Postal Service
is under the United States this one's under the United States of America
United States two different corporations two different entities one's a
corporation one isn't one's dour one's de facto USPS is not the same as uspo a
lot on envelopes for a long time I will write on the envelope right under my
stamp to be delivered by the uspo and I walk into the same office
deposit but they have to do what I tell them to do so the US Post Office delivers my
mail not the US Postal Service it crimps the paper into the
seal so it's raised see that's the thing about a warrant a war rant is a declaration of
war upon you if it doesn't have a raise Court
seal it ain't worth the paper it's written on so when you challenge a cop and say
that's not a warrant yeah where do you get this SMU that's what I tell him I
joke with him I just smile shake his hand how you doing hope you're having a good day because I'm about to give you a
hard time right and I'm going to be nice about it but where do you get this SMU
it's just made up I said where's the wedding signature of the judge where's the raised core seal is it from
on article one or article 3 court is it backed up by a claim an affidavit or testimony sworn under the penalty of
perjury by somebody if not it's just SMU get the hell off my property you're trespassing
this is your Final Notice come back when you have something
sorry about your luck but be nice smile it's all on how
you handle it okay up you can order you can order them you can
go down to you can go down to Office Depot and order it see she just stamped
her raised notary seal feel that that's a warrant's got to have one
of those with the Court's information on it okay feel
it our government was created under trust read the Declaration of
Independence read the Preamble it's a trust in denter it was created under
trust as a republic they owe us a republic form of
government that's their trust indenture we are the fiduciaries as a
state National as a we the people that's the United States Post Office United
States Postal Service doesn't include general delivery when I write my address
typically I write in care of rural route right right there and then I write
the street address and then I write the city and then I write the state spelled
out oron not o does that need to be all
caps no do not make it in all caps absolutely
not no I put the zip code in brackets for
the square four corner rule to take it out of the contract only five put the
five numbers in and then an good thing to do is WDC without
DC does that takes it out of the federal district see if I'm in
Oregon and I get a Federal indictment the feds come after me for some bold
madeup stuff right and they indict me in Oregon I'm I'm not charged in Oregon I'm
charged in the Ninth District of Washington
DC they're they're using they're using a different
venue a map overlay as I explained yesterday how Maps work they just make a
whole bunch of clerical errors on a map overlay and you either acence or you say
no collect the correct the errors and then I'll accept of it anyway how does the postmaster fit into the deao
indure how does he fit in both exist simultaneously it's just like the United
States of America exists at the same exact time as
the United States it's just like Utah exists at the same time as the state of
Utah one's a corporation located in Washington DC one's right here this geographical
area are you a uton then you're a State national you're on the land you owe your
allegiance to the state if you're a US citizen where do
you owe your allegiance to see this hat right
here under President Obama this said United
States President Trump gave me this hat says United States of America
okay yeah yeah he's restoring the Republic
now it's up to us all he's doing is giving it back to us now we got to go do something with
it I hope there's enough people to do something with it voter versus
elector uh this this one isn't on your steps yet I keep it off your steps because boy
does people will screw up when it comes to this so usually once they get these
steps this is becomes class three or four right here
okay your notice of electoral status to the Secretary of
State once you become a state National you're not a voter anymore see what is the difference a voter votes for their
leaders an elector elects their
representatives okay are you a voter or an
elector that's because you quit being a state National so you create an electoral
college that goes and votes on your behalf as a citizen because that's all
the slaves can do but once you're State national and we
the people we elect our representatives and I can and I can
declare my electorial status and then every vote I vote counts
for four when I when I checked with the state department this probably been four maybe five years ago I asked him how
many state Nationals there were in the United States and it how I did it with
with a foer request so they sent it back to me and
they told me how many there was and back then there was about 45,000
total and then I thought to myself dang I should have asked this question too so
I sent in another foyer request and I says how many state Nationals out of the
45,000 via this foyer request see attached are bar
members oh man and it was about
40,000 oh yeah they take advantage of this they're not dummies well that's why
when I see some of them in these courts there some of these proceedings there represent it's why it's so hard to hang
Hillary Clinton and so Bill and those guys it's so hard you have to have such
good evidence to charge a State national with they have to have either done one
of two things physically harm someone
themselves and we all know they hire done or commit
treason yeah they've done this is what we're going to get her
on treason and Sedition treason and Sedition we're going to get her on shouldn't even go into this up until
last week up until last week we never had any physical evidence
that she harmed someone else or Bill actually harms someone else that can be
proved even the people that who who know he they he raped her for instance they
don't swear anything under the penalty of perjury they usually get paid off and they go away okay so they don't really
come forward so to speak but what if we
had her handprint in the blood of a victim
[Music] oh just throwing that out there get through the steps then email me how do I
become an elector okay then I'll help you but if you don't get through the steps there's
no sense of me even telling you how to become an elector I'm just telling you it's out
there okay I can walk in with my electoral document that's
that's authentic ated by the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon walk into a voting booth and vote and my vote
counts for four people record everything everything becomes a court of record yes I know
okay your documents become a court of record when properly served publicly published
and filed okay all right registered mails Ser the
United States Post Office same as a court I don't need to hire
a no only if you go through the United States Postal Service how do you know
see here's you guys it's all about
jurisdiction here here's the deal what is a court I said this yesterday what is
a court bank it's a bank if you look up the word Court in a blacks law fourth
edition legal dictionary it says C Bank C Posta office you look up the word
judge it says C Banker C postmaster all courts in the United
States were set up is United States District postal courts if you go back
East where the buildings are older than on the west you'll see cour houses that say
post offices Courthouse post office Courthouse right on the building in
stone that was carved 300 years ago okay that's how they were set up
Benjamin Franklin set it up that way okay as our first Postmaster
General so if we use the United States Post Office which is registered mail
nowadays you walk in you ask for register mail return receipt they don't what just send a certifi it no no no
that's not what I asked see I don't want to go through the US Postal Service I want to go through the United States
Post Office I want to registered mail return receipt that's certified now it's a court
document you understand it's the same as a court a court is a post office a post
office is a court United States Post Office is a court now I've got a court
document is served by the court so well
it depends on how they were served did you have a sheriff Serv it that's okay did you have a court officer service
that's okay did you have a notary public serve
it no notary service see notaries can serve
documents yes did you have yourself and two other Witnesses with one of your
other Witnesses actually do the service and you all three swore to it under oath penalty of perjury that's
okay that's okay
hold on registered mail is served by the post office by hand delivery like it was
with the Pony Express right it never enters a airplane it is trucked across under lock and key box so it's always in
secured position certified can go any which way they want because it's not
part of the post office it's part of the post office absolutely looking at that from a legal
perspective service that is 10 times more powerful than certified mail though
the courts want to always send everything certified IRS certified I sent it I sent something back before I
met my wife registered mail back to the IRS and they went silent because they
could not they cannot answer a registered mail P because it's hand
delivered and certified service certified to go comes under administrative and they can do whatever
they want it's administrative is so the registered mail
oh like you can walk what I experienced is you can walk in a post office get a big stack of those green cards that
meaning they're worthless we discovered as you go into a post office and you want to get the
registered mail the little pink red ones they guard those under lock and key smarter post offices in bigger cities
are like they they will only give you that once you pay for that at the counter and they're really strict if
they pass those out they get in huge big trouble however we discovered you go to some little outlining post offices they
don't really know what's going on and you say hey I want to get a big I want to get like 30 of those things and they
just hand them to you they don't know that but they can get actually in big trouble but you get those because then
what we do is we embed the number the reg because it's a bond you embed that registered mail number at the top of all
your documents so it's like then now your documents are all bonded then you
you can't do that at the post office let you actually I did I would bring my computer and a printer to I do it there
that I found out hey let's get them ahead of time yeah that's the 200 label that I was telling you about oh what was
that the 200 label is what they call it oh okay yeah so anyway also you know
it's different I knew it was different because then when you hand them thing with the registered mail they actually have a special bag that they put it in
back in there it's like uh the old he was talking about like the oldfashioned postal back so the lesson of the story
is if you can find a postal employee who's not aware of the protocol and they hand you a bunch of those uh you made
out big time fact we're done with that subject registered versus certified I think we
pretty much beat the dog to death would this be the issue with mailin voting is because I mean I know it's a broken
chain but if if they were all registered then they'd be locked right and delivered and they're going to not do it
register they're going to do it by regular USPS and they can do anything they want with our voting let me tell
you something Oregon's probably one of the worst states and the best examples
of voter fraud in the world we've been doing vote by mail for 25 years ever
since we started we've never had a republican Governor it's been a Democratic governor
since the day they started voting by mail you travel anywhere where in the
vast majority of the state of Oregon and you won't see one Biden sign you will
see Trump signs everywhere we hold a rally I just spoke in front of the women
for Trump group 150 plus women for an hour before we started the
speech they stood on the sidewalks on a fairly busy highway and I mean
busy um right by the first stoplight coming into town and they line the sidewalks on both
sides and they had their flags and their women for Trump pink shirts on and and
uh other various signs and the cars coming by were honking and yelling and shouting
for Trump people were going home in their cars in their pickup trucks and fly getting their flags and coming back
and making multiple passes about two three cars out of every
hundred would yell Biden and Boo and you know all this crap out the
window maybe two or three out of a hundred that just shows
you you know I said this the other day president Trump does an in a sparsely
populated state of South Dakota at a park that only 7500 people can attend
six per car he had 150,000 people apply for tickets in two hours the first two
hours of the lottery to get in Biden can't fill a hotel conference
room him he announces his vice presidential pick they show up in Central Park in New York most populated
city in our country and they don't have 150 people listening to them in the
park are you kidding me he can't feel bad
okay and the polls CNN poll says binds the head by seven
points where the heck they getting that number yeah it's
SMU I don't know why I'm holding this got a mic on

agency have they researched Child Protective Services in their that area to see if they're a private for-profit
entity you just believe their government very few child Protective
Services agencies in this country are government they're private for-profit
businesses they're like subcontractors just like the military

countries before the military even gets there and they're doing stuff the
military can't even do Under the UCMJ
okay I think Eric Prince is a son of a by the ways I met him in
person but he works for the dod so that's okay

actor that's Latin on March 13 2017 the president of
the United States issued a lawful executive order number 13781 in which the president Donald J Trump as
president of the United States of America asked for help from We the People to assist in the restructuring of
the executive branch citing the QAM provision of 31 us code section 3730 B C
I am following set executive order in a continued effort to expose the continued assaults upon the court by frauds upon
the court through malfeasance of office and prosecutorial misconducts resulting in
iments violations in order for this fiduciary to effectively make his report to the
president of the United States per executive order 13781 and
13825 we must first Define in context and apply the following three terms as
outlined in the executive order as viewed by the court under the Equal protections promise beyond their
dictionary definitions as follows an emolument and then I use the Latin term
terminology for emoluments meaning in order rightly to comprehend a
thing it is necessary first to inquire into the names for a right knowledge of things depends on their
names this is where we separate the men from the boys right here definition any
advantage profit or gain received as a result of one's employment or holding of
office Lial the law punishes falsehood I use
the Latin definition and it means the law punishes falsehood the definition
publish false statements that is damaging to a person's reputation a written
defamation okay a fiary duty Justice is to be denied to no one I use the Latin
term and then I it means justices to be denied for No One definition a fiary
duty is a legal duty to act solely in another part's interest parties owing this Duty are called
fiduciaries the individuals to whom they owe a duty are called principles fiies
may not profit from their relationship with their principles unless they have the principles expressed in formed
consent they also have a duty to avoid any conflicts of interest between themselves and their principles or
between their principles and the fiies and other clients a fiary duty is the strictest duty of care recognized by the
United States legal system Capital felony treason is committed by any actor
of a foreign State acting as a public servant pretending to be government who denies or deprives one of We the People
any right given by God listed or written in any International treaty or any Constitution of the United States of
America or any one of its states in Tim holth case Kirk
Pendergrass and I stood in court on behalf of Tim holth who sat right there
and we called the judge out three times on the record for Capital felony
treason I walked up to the judge and I put my hand on his shoulder and I said you're under
arrest and I I said I'll let you go if you dismiss this case with prejudice and
you remove yourself from the court and he
did and in Tim's followup cases every time we remove the judge from the
case you can't do that unless you do this okay otherwise they'll arrest you
and throw you in jail so it's a dangerous thing to do and it takes a a lot of guts but Kirk stood
there in a suit and he talks really good and he's smart he knows everything and
he knows the law and can quote it up one side down the other and I stand there in tactical gear at military
attention and I make the
arrest it does okay deprivation of rights under
color law USC title 18 section 242 C attached exhibits I actually go to the
Department of Justice's website and I got William bar to do this about a year and a half
ago uh we took certain titles that pertained a lot to We the People to
protect us from government and I asked the doj to make
PDF files on their letterhead that give a summary at the
top half of the page a summary of what the title meant and then State the title
at the bottom and so they did title 241 and they did 242 and they did a few
others that we asked them to do and it's really great because you can go to their website you can search for it you can
pull up on their letterhead I recommend printing them off and hand them out like candy every time a police officer stops

over them they're not used to that it shocks the hell out of them they they walk up to the car window I roll the car
down and said hi offer how you doing I reach right across my 9 mm and a shoulder holster with a with a silencer
on it it's got a Navy sealed knife next to it because normally I wear them in
the s in the summertime I don't like to but I I've always wear a Sig with
silencer and a Navy SEAL knife under this one fanging on my belt and you know I'm well prepared well trained right and
I just reached right across there it is he doesn't want to leave the window now right but I just shake his I'm real nice
and tell him ask him how he's doing hope he's having a good day he's being safe I would really want him to go home to his
family and I mean that and I let him know that I mean it and then he says can I have your dy's license perfect
insurance and registration you were going 20 M hour a speed limit I said I was being safe you had to pull out a
parking lot just to to find me on the road I said I'm the only car on the road usually right I said no but here's my
passport it's the only document I use while I'm traveling he calls his little partner up
hands him the passport his partner goes back there scans it they have a little powow on the back corner of my car and
he walks back up and he hands it to me and says be on your way have a nice day one day this happened in Burns Oregon
and I was on the phone with her and the officer got all done said be
on your way I says I think I'm going to there's a McDonald's in the parking lot I'm a little thirsty I'm going to go reward myself with a chocolate
shake how long did it take about a minute and a half
I'm done I'm out of there I'm on the road I dropped a a person off about a
year ago I was doing the class in Logan I had to drop somebody off at the Salt Lake City airport I was on my way back
up 15 there or whatever that road that connects to 15 I was on that road police
officer stopped me I was on the phone again this guy took a little bit of time
back at his car it took me 3 minutes and 7 seconds before I was back on the road doing 60
see and it happens all the time they a lot
ofac no it is it is all about being nice
and having the right documentation and then you have limited diplomatic Community this is another
thing I also carry I get the ones from the KO Institute because
they're exact ex actly the same as a yeah every time I go to DC I pick up
some more they're from the KO Institute in Washington DC the nice thing about this is it's got
the Declaration of Independence it's got the Constitution it's it's got all the signatures of everybody on and on and
on yes they do sure yeah yeah there there's been 10,000
court cases say we have the right to travel yeah like they just trip you no
they understand it they just trip you up because you're a citizen typical you hand him a driver's license per of
insurance registration and then you say but I have the right to travel no you
don't not by the time you did all that now you're subject see yeah I mean it's a real simple thing
to be free once you've changed your mindset once you've
I'm going to call it repented for all the mistakes you've made in the past and you do your documentation to reverse
those now you're truly free again like you were when you were born between April 20th and may the 3D I was a State
national okay what was the Red Book it's a declaration of independence and the
Constitution oh yeah it's just it's easy to carry because it's exactly made out
of the the same materials same size same shape as the passport so I carry them
together okay can I can I establish correct the status for my
children you can as your minor property your minor children cor my
stat you can do it all in one document now here's the thing when they reach 18
they have the option to do whatever they want in fact you need to educate them
because along the way they may override what you did by checking boxes I'm you assist them
okay in the federal government's rules you're really a nonresident alien of Washington DC
that's what a State national is a nonresident alien of Washington DC so
when you go get your driver's license you write nonresident alien
it'll say US citizen or other Mark other and put non-res
alien if I'm driving my Uber if I'm hauling pastors For Hire if
I want to be a bus driver if I want to be a public public servant in the performance of my public
duties if I want to be a truck driver yeah State national could be
anything they want to be but you still certain industries are regulated
the states can regulate commerce they can't interfere in it so they've
regulated Trucking they've regulated transportation of passengers they've
regulated public servant if you have one of those Li
and you're driving private absolutely not if I'm driving my
Uber I'm going to hand a driver's license perect insurance registration that's the jurisdiction I'm in when
you're not when I'm not if I'm going to the grocery store I'm going to hand him my passport I'm
traveling I'm traveling in my private automobile I'm not driving or operating a motor
vehicle see the difference in diction words are everything learn the English
language diction is everything look every word up if you don't know what the
meaning of a word is stop put the brakes on look the word up not in
Websters not on Wiki in a legal dictionary Congress uses
bers I like the older versions of Black's Law sometimes look it up in two or three
you'll get different meanings sometimes here's one thing the bar association is good at changing the meaning of words
don't let them get away with it if they've changed the meaning of a word to something you don't like Define your
word in your document then make it a court of record and they have to go by your definition I could call a pig a dog and
Define it and I make it a courter record they got to call that pig a
dog it's that simple right it's true because that's what I
believe it to be and I made it ACC courter record they have to go by what I
say what addition I like fourth or fifth the more
the bar Associated and corrupt stuff the worse it gets
so yeah yeah pretty soon it's going to be a Sears robot catalog in an out house
is there any reason to get a passport card what's that all about I was wondering why go get your
passport if you want the extra cards buy them after you've done your passport the right way yeah so but do your passport
exactly like I tell you to do it on that form and you won't have any
problem sometimes you got to fight with them a little bit but that's part of having Dominion
having strength having the knowledge to stand and say uhuh buddy the United
States code defines status like this they wouldn't Define it if they didn't accept it this is my choice of status
issue me a passport that reflects that status thank you very much get it done have a nice day we're
all happy don't let them talk you into don't let them throw bear traps out you and try and convince you and try and
sway your opinion be firm in your foundation lay down The rules tell them
how it is and demand that our public servants do what you tell them to do I want to make sure this weekend that I
help you all with any problems you may have or any problems you have coming up
in the future so if you have questions I don't care if it's about the IRS if it's
about traffic if it's about what I can probably help you with them
sure yeah am I going to go to court for you no I'll teach you how to solve it
first of all the states have gotten wonderful in fact Oregon because it's
been so Democratic for 25 years that they've been mailing in ballots Oregon Department of Revenue has
been one of the worst here's what happens when you call the Oregon Department of Revenue
you get some little lady on the phone usually and you say oh I got this
problem and you lay this story out and I need to get it rectified and I want to get it settled how do I settle it and
she says oh have you have you written many letters have you done done this done that I recommend doing
that and you hang up the phone maybe you write a letter or two and you call and your Corp respond you they can't even
answer any saking questions for you they can't they don't do it they got like this telephone operating room they got
all these people in it you call back you're going to get another person and they can't transfer you the one that
you've already told the story to so you're telling the same story over and over and over again this goes on for
weeks and they do it on purpose they want you to get so frustrated you just give up pay your damn bill and it just
goes on and it goes on and it goes on let me talk to a supervisor let me
talk to a lean specialist if they put a lean on your property and you finally get to one of those guys and they go oh
well have you have you sent in any paperwork well I mean has it gone anywhere I mean have you contacted one
of the directors I'm contacting you right now you're the lean specialist oh
well I can't do anything for you I can't remove a lean and they give you the runaround on
and on and on and on and on and that's probably what you found in any state right
okay I'm going to give you a little keys that it took me a while to learn finally
I ran into this little gal named Pam and I think I intimidated her so badly that
she caved and she says you have to ask for a level three auditor
if you don't ask he's the only one that can make a decision on your tax case
that's it just him and you have to ask for a
hearing in front of a level three
auditor took me a year and a half to learn that
well I'm trying to beat him back with a stick a year and a half to learn that I
had to go for a level three auditor and guess what when I finally found the laws
it's the same in every state they're all set up the same
way you have to ask for a level three auditor you have to ask for a hearing
now you prepare your story based upon placing the burden of
proof on them was there a certified audit
done how did you arrive at the figure that you say I owe was there a certified
audit done place your burden of proof back on
them do it in such a way and I'm going to talk about Dynamic negotiation in a minute but do it in such a way that you
pin them into a corner and in such a way that they feel
that if they took you to Tax Court they might not win the minute you do that and in my
case $6,595 is what they said I
owed and in one hour and 56 minutes I took him to the challenge in a hearing
and I got a little notice back 20 they have to call you within so if your hearing appointments at 10:00 a.m. they
have to call you before 10:00 a.m. the next following business day now if
there's a did it on a Friday there's a weekend in there it's Monday they got to call you before that 24-hour business
day if you had a hearing if you from your hearing day they won't make a decision in the hearing usually it's a
level three auditor sitting there looking like a judge and a level two auditor over here learning his job and a
level two auditor over here learning his job they're learning what that guy does
so when they get promoted they'll know what to do so you get three people in
there and you're in this courtroom like situation nobody else in the room you
and these three guys okay so you just set up a hearing I
called for a hearing I had a hearing the next day walk in there in an hour and 56
minutes I laid it out for him at 9:55 the next
morning five minutes before their 24 hours was up he called me and said you have a zero balance can you come in and
pick up the paperwork and I beat
him because they couldn't prove their burden of proof they knew
they couldn't prove their burden of proof therefore case dismissed what else did you Sayid
certified huh you're asking I spoke for an hour and 56 minutes I know because I
recorded it that's a lot more than you certified yeah yeah it is but I'm telling you this
is just the key to even getting it heard otherwise you're going to get the
runaround for the next year until you give up and write them my check the Internal Revenue Service is the easiest
to beat in the history of the world and every attorney will tell you H don't
fight them they're so hard it's pathetic they're so hard what did I tell you the
entire title 26 the United States code is not law first of all second of all
it's a gift tax they can't tax a sweat of your brow unless you're a public
servant so he's got to pay taxes sorry about your luck selfy
same that's the sweat of my bre yeah but it's on your LLC I mean it's your penalty for setting
up an LLC that's so proprietorship why would you register a
sole proprietorship I was just asking I okay Soul proprietor you got all the
blame all the risk all the everything you don't want to be Soul no I'm just wondering well if you put all your
assets in a in a foundation or in a trust and you're a sole proprietorship and you don't own nothing who
cares let them come after you can't get blood out of a
turnup see I was just curious if there was a way to that one was a so proprietor of of
business for I'm all about making your business
something else a PMA a trading company uh uh you know the only reason to create
a business in the water an actual Corporation is to protect yourself through title 15 in Commerce and that is
only to protect your vessel that's right okay that's the only reason to do that
to have a business there's no other reason to register a business with a state except
to protect your vessel no if you want to run a business
and make money do it as a private membership Association the IRS is easy to beat
okay they have to follow procedure and they never do they never follow due process they never do a certified audit
because of article 26 no they just never do I mean I'm talking about against you a US citizen
they never do due process ever so you
get them on due process charges they they never do a certified audit
where' they come up with a figure they say you SMU out of thin
air they have to provide you with a certified audit they almost never do
expensive second of that's right second of all yeah usually it's not worth their
time on 600 bucks for you know it wouldn't be worth their time they're just going to write that off okay second
of all they got to follow due process law they got to follow banking law they set up the rules they're a collection
agency for the bank that's what they are the IRS is nothing more than a collection agency do you know they have
a debit and a credit department Ogden Utah right here you
could send it to the i period R here let's talk about this we talked about
USPS versus
uspo right how about I period r period S
period versus the
Internal Revenue Service know thy enemy okay want you to
believe me when I say this so I helped the guy write an
affidavit he owed almost a million dollars to the IRS they're coming after him hard I helped him write an affidavit
we wrote this affidavit he starts filling out the envelope manila envelope to mail the affidavit to him in and he
writes i period r period S period I go wait stop let's write Internal Revenue
Service attention credit department at the same address in Ogden
Utah and then put the zip code in Brackets that's the only change I had to
make the documents already on the inside already said Internal Revenue Service
he mails them off he gets a letter back from Bank of
America Bank of America bought the Internal Revenue
Service Credit department and you know what they
did they went off his birth certificate because we included it as an exhibit in the document and they gave him a credit
of 1 million some odd dollars and some
cents because we made him a creditor instead of a debtor and we sent to the credit
department now he had a credit on his taxes what of a million
dollar how does that work I'd like to know that myself but it all has to do with the cess QV
trust fun fun little things you learn along the
way no before I do anything I change people's status if I'm going to help you
do something your status is getting changed if you don't want to change it truck off on down the road okay I got a
guy that went to prison for five years he got out he's on probation part of his deal with the
federal court sh part of his deal with the federal court is that he had to pay back
the IRS I sent a very similar affidavit to
the IRS for him and the IRS sends a letter back we're not going to pursue
you anymore your balance is zero he' already served 5 years in prison for an IRS
debt well guess what he's still on probation the court got the document as
well and closed his federal court case it's closed it's done it's over
with the IRS isn't pursuing it the IRS has zero balance probation is a private
for-profit business separate from the court separate from the
IRS and the only thing they care about is they had an order from the court to
follow through on his probation requirements so the man's still on
probation they still ask him for a financial report every month so he can pay the IRS
that he doesn't even know so he just turns in a financial report and he never has to write a check
because his they call and his balance is zero but is every month they get have to
get a financial report how much M money did you make this month what were your expenses because he's
self-employed and he keeps turning in and they have to keep coming and checking on where he sleeps at night
about once a month they check on him where he's at he can't leave the state he can't get a passport he can't until
his probation's D up which isn't for another 10 months from now so probations
are still running his freaking life as far as he everybody's concerned the court case is closed the IRS I solve
those two issues but I can't do I can't get through to probation if I send a document about
probation to the court the court says Hey the case is closed we
we don't need it they're all private for-profit corporations they all have done brass that's why I'm trying to tell
you there's no desure government right now except what's inside you and me when we become a state National we're
self-governed we're part of the United States of America same with the prison systems all the prison systems are
private a lot of Judges own the prisons they got stock in the prison
companies isn't it to their financial best interest to put you in your prison that they have stock in I know they get
paid by the bed I'm telling you we we the people have been letting all these people get away with murder for a long
time literally yeah Bill Gates has committed genocide in Africa 400,000
children 400,000 children in India is what I was about to say as well do these
cases set precedence right when you're state National and you
do a case when it's done and over with quite often they wipe it off the face of the
Earth they don't want some law student at Cornell or Harvard to pull up the case and say oh shoot this is what we
got to do to win every single case they don't want that to happen they'd go broke fast those Banks would plunge into
bankruptcy the banks called courts would plunge into bankruptcy so even like
Gina's case here in Utah we filed over 700 pages of
documents when she had already been tried she had already been found guilty
by a jury I met her after her trial and before
sentencing and taught her what she needed to do I taught her that it requires three signatures to put herself
into jail and they were going to sentence her for 15 years of her life
I told her she couldn't have an attorney she had to be competent she couldn't take a plea
deal okay those are the three things you have to do or have to know and I taught
her all this and in doing so in teaching the court since we got to tell them all three times usually we filed over 700
pages of documents with all the affidavit and things like that when
they dismissed her case and sent her home even after she had been tried and
found guilty by a jury and sent her home they handed her back 700 pages of court
documents and said just take those we don't want
them isn't that unusual no that's what they always do
for us see like I said they're in a business
a private for-profit business they have a Dun and Brader number seven
County courts in the state of Utah are owned by one guy in Ogden Utah that's
where his office headquarters are he owns them just like he would McDonald's
franchises what's his name are they government no they're de facto they're
acting as a governmental Services Corporation on behalf of the Department
of Justice under the GSA program of the state it's a general State
accounts but they call it something else but it that's what it started off as the
General State accounts the federal government buys all the court cases from
the states under the GSA program and then Mary from the federal
court handles it through the department of fiscal Services gets all that money
back it's a business
yeah okay I read this document in every class because it's so important so to give you
a little history of this document why I came up with
it is I was on a plane ride and I was surrounded by these guys
in some really expensive suits and I was listening to what they were
saying and they were talking about the law and I found out they were lawyers for the banks the international
Bankers who were because we were all going I I went to sign on behalf of 14
Sovereign Nations as their ambassador to sign for the sovereignty
accounts with the World
Bank it's kind of like the convention of States program if not enough States sign
on it doesn't matter anyway but right now there's probably 16 or 17 signatures of
countries to declare their sovereignty to declare their own money to declare
their own money backed by gold and silver and I signed on behalf of 14 of
them but I sit with this group of attorneys and they were all talking about banking law and all that crap and
I sat there and I bit my tongue for about three and a half hours it was a 9-h hour plane
ride and then I couldn't help myself so I jumped into the Ed the
education mode and I started educating them about the basics of law land air
and water and the three jurisdictions and how damn attorneys misuse the term jurisdiction on purpose to confuse the
general public and on and on and on and I started educating them after a few
minutes uh maybe a half an hour one of them piped up and says well who are
you because I'm s I'm dressed like this on the plane tactical boots tactical
pants just a regular shirt and they said who are you and I
said H nobody I'm just a farm boy from a Midtown in oreg
and they said n come on you know way too much I said my name's David
straight and this one guy pipes up and he goes oh you're the guy the bar association's trying to shut down and I
said me really why would they try and shut me down I said I don't think they
can shut me up much less shut me down and another guy goes well they're
going to get you is syllogism that that's what I said I went
what silly what
syllogism but when he said that all the others went like you weren't supposed to
say that right because it was easy that's the way my neck turns anyway that that's what they they did
they looked at him like you weren't supposed to tell them that see that's a mistake they made when they tell me
something I'm going to research and look it up and know the hell out of it right so I spent the rest of the
flight learning about syllogism
always okay so let's talk about
syllogism it's a noun an instance of a form of reasoning
in which a conclusion is drawn whether it's valid or or not I found that part
to be interesting whether it's valid or not from two given or
assumed propositions or premises Each of which shares a term
with the conclusion and shares a common or middle term not present in the conclusion now does that make any sense
whatsoever [Music] okay so for instance all dogs are
animals all dogs have four legs therefore all animals have four
legs the problem here is not all animals have four legs so they use a couple of facts and
twist the conclusion through syllogism it's a deductive reasoning as
distinct from induction this school of epistemology is
highly advanced in syllogism and logical reasoning in other words no fact or
truth shall be tried in court this is how they get you the bar tries to destroy us using syllogism of the 12
presumptions of Court we can't accept presumption
assumption Ted agreement in hearsay we can't be led down that path so I made
the 12 presumptions of Court along with syllogism an
exhibit to file with our documents but this is how it
goes all shall be considered rebutted that's my
headline all shall be considered rebutted in canon law
32:28 a Roman Court does not operate according to any true rule of
law but by presumptions of the
law therefore if presumptions presented by the private bar Guild are not
rebutted they become fact and are therefore said to stand true or as truth
in Commerce I told you if a prosecutor gets up on stage lies his ass off and you
don't rebut or your attorney doesn't rebut those lies become the truth and fact upon the record how do you do that
in court how do you do I object it's a lie your
honor speak upay heay it's SMU your
honor don't think I haven't said that a million
times there are 12 key presumptions asserted by the private bar Guild which
if unchallenged make it a little bigger so
I can read it better which if unchallenged stand true being public
record Public Service public oath immunity summons custody court of
Guardians Court of Trustees government is executive beneficiary executive dant tort
incompetence and guilt those are the 12 presumptions of court so I'm going to go
through them one by one the presumption of public record is
that any matter brought before a lower Roman court is a matter for the public record when in fact it is presumed by
the members of the private bar Guild that the matter is a private bar Guild business
matter did you understand what I just said let me do it again because this is important the presumption of public
record is p presumption of public record so you believe a quarter record is that
brick building down there you have a presumption that that's a court of record you think anything you say is on
the record I've already told you to make your documents a court of record so that
they can't be just administratively thrown away or thrown out or deemed hearsay or we can't you know so now
anything you say is now right
so the presumption of public recors that any matter brought before a lower court
is a matter for the public record when in fact it is presumed by the members of
the private bar Guild the bar association that it is a private bar
Guild business matter it's their business you walked into their business under General
appearance and it became a private bar member matter of
business and you thought you were getting Justice and that you were putting your facts upon the record when
they're thinking no fact or truth shall be tried in court damn Liars they're liars and
thieves I keep telling okay unless openly rebuked and rejected
by stating clearly the matter is to be on the public record the matter remains a private bar Guild matter completely
under private bar Guild rules so unless you rebuke the
presumption and reject it and demand that it's on the public record or make your documents a courter record then
what they say becomes the public then they think it's completely under private bar Guild
rules that's why these courts have local rules as a state National do you think I
have to obey their local rules no I tell them what to do I don't
got to go by their local rules okay number two the presumption of
public service is that all the members of the private bar Guild who have sworn a
solemn secret absolute oath to their Guild their first oath is to the bar
not not the Constitution not to
you who have sworn a solemn public oath remain Bound by that oath and therefore
bound to serve honestly impartiality and fairly as dictated by
their oath and less openly challenged and demanded the presumption
stands that the private bar Guild members have functioned under their public oath in contradiction to their
Guild oath every bar member takes two
Oaths one to the bar and one to the
public but they always stand under the oath to the bar first unless you rebut
and make them stand under the oath to the public unless openly rebuked and rejected the claim stands that the
private bar Guild members are legitimate public servants and therefore trustees
under the public oath the presumption of public oath is
that all members of the private bar Guild acting in the capacity of public officials who have sworn a solemn public
oath remain Bound by that oath if challenged such individuals must recuse themselves
as having a conflict of interest and cannot possibly stand under a public
oath so as you challenge them to which oath they are operating
under and once you do that they have to admit it that they're operating under
the oath of the bar this is why the judge the prosecutor and your or
attorney put you in jail there are three signatures put you in jail or you sign a
plea and put yourself in jail one one of the three things happen I mean those three things
happen Okay the presumption of immunity is that members of the private bar Guild in the
capacity of public officials acting as judges prosecutors and magistrates who
have sworn a solemn public oath in good faith are immune from personal claims of
injury and liability unless openly challenged and their oath
demanded the presumption stands that the members of the private bar Guild as public trustees acting as judges
prosecutors and magistrates are immune from any personal accountability for their actions so if you don't go in and
challenge their oath then they're immune from you coming
back later and Prosecuting them that's why I challenge their oath
judge do you claim to derive your authority over me based upon your oath of office and
any other requirement of the state to be a judge yes or
no see there's a reason I do say that
question the presumption of summons is that by custom a summons unrebutted
stands and therefore one who attends court is presumed to accept a
position and jurisdiction of the Court just by showing up under General
appearance you just show up you're subject to the jurisdiction of the court
it's why we if we're going to appear we got to appear by special appearance and it's best to appear by
special Divine appearance see attendance to court is usually
invitation by some unless a summons is rejected and
returned you can reject the summ didn't I tell you you have a 72h hour wrer refusal of
anything unless the summon is rejected in return with a copy of the rejection
filed prior to choosing to visit or attend what did that say though choosing
to visit or attend whose choice is it that's right by choosing to visit or attend
jurisdiction and position as the accused and the existence of guilt
stands what did that just say unless the summons is rejected and
return with a copy of the rejection filed prior to choosing to visit or
attend jurisdiction and position as the accused
and the existence of guilt
stands just by showing up your presumed
guilty just by showing up by General appearance you've accepted jurisdiction
and you're presumed guilty CPR citizen person resident they get your tasked
agreement they presume your status they assume you've done something wrong that's the Assumption of guilt
they get your Ted agreement of you being a citizen person resident and then they use hearsay to convict you what does hearsay alive right these are actors
acting in a position of government and you believing that they're in a position of government
therefore you consent and you're presumed guilty right off the
GGO if someone is presumed guilty who's the burden of proof on they just place it Bound to You
they don't have to they got your consent which is
basically yeah and so they scare the heck out of you they tell you to sign
this plea deal right here and we'll only find you $1,200 instead of 2,000 and
we'll only give you six months in jail instead of a year and a half and uh you know they'll make it sound really good
but if they give you any sentence they can collect from your trust for the penal sum as long as they can hold your
body assurity for the bond they can collect from your trust I know just going I can't believe
that yeah that's right ignorance of the law
is no excuse they tell you that right how many law classes did they give you kindergarten through 12th grade the
presumption of custody is that by custom a summons or warrant for arrest
unrebutted stands and therefore one who attends court is presumed to be a thing and
therefore liable to be detained in custody by the custodians this includes the dead legal
fiction non-human person that corporate government rules and regulations are written
for custodians may only lawfully hold custody of property and things not flesh
and blood Souls possess ing beans flesh and blood soul possessing a
being that's pretty good I like that unless this presumption is openly
challenged by rejection of the summons Andor at the court the presumption
stands you are a thing and property and therefore lawfully able to be kept in
custody by the custodians you're just a vessel a ship a
thing a property look you get a ticket in the
mail or buy a cop or a summons or a letter from the IRS or I don't care what
it's got your all caps name on there right
David you got 72 hours so if you're
smart you would date stamp and time the receipt

shredder Genie went home fixed dinner called me on the phone says thanks a lot
Dave that simple you're offer a contract I'm teaching you how to be free here
autom traveling in private in my private automobile it's private they don't have
any control over your private business Affairs the United States code was put
there for one reason one reason only and that's for We the People to hold our Public Service accountable they operate
under the United States code when they do a the federal government does a lawsuit and they put the United States
code because you did this and you did that and here's the code and here's this they're just claiming you're one of them
that you're a citizen therefore an employee of government so they're holding you accountable to their codes
as one of them see not as a man but we get that all caps letter in
the mail we go oh shoot I got a letter from the court today no you didn't your bestel got a letter from the
court not you David could somebody do this if they haven't claimed their
status yet sure sure it's more effective when you
claimed your status okay in case you're challenged where was
I Court of seven Court of Guardians is that where I was oh yeah I love this one
oh gosh listen closely this one's fun the presumption of court of
Guardians is the presumption that as you may be listed as a
resident you're Award of a local government area and have listed on your
passport the letter P you are a popper and therefore under the guardian powers
of the government and its agents as a court of Guardians unless this presumption is openly challenged to
demonstrate your both a general guard guardian and general executive of the
matter of the trust before the court the presumption stands that you are by default a popper and a lunatic and
therefore must obey the rules of the cirk of guardians or the cirk of magistrates
Court they got the nerve to call you a
lunatic see you're incompetent you're infirmed you're a minor you're a ward of
the state a ward of the Court you're unable to speak for yourself that's the only people an
attorney can represent I just listed them all off they can't represent a man or a
woman somebody sued jur of One's Own right they can't represent
you so if you walk into court and the judge says you got to take this attorney he's calling you a freaking lunatic and
a w of the court and a w of the state and incompetent and unable to speak for yourself and a
minor you saying you're not a man don't stand up here you haven't proven
yourself you haven't taken dominion over your jurisdictions and you haven't taken your
status you haven't claimed your status and you sure sure as heck haven't claimed your minor
account so what are the three things we got to do claim our status claim dominion over our three jurisdictions
and claim our minor account now you're Sue jurist now you're of One's Own rights now they are your public servants
start ordering them around order them around be nice about it but order him
around treat him as your neighbor number eight is the presumption of Court of
Trustees is that members of the private bar Guild presume you accept the office of
trustee as a public servant and government employee just by attending a court as
such courts are always for public trustees by the rules of the guild and the Roman system unless this presumption
is openly challenged to State you are merely visiting by special invitation
only to clear up the matter and you are not a government employee or Public
Trustee in this instance the presumption stands and is assumed as one of the most
significant reasons to claim jurisdiction simply because you
appeared this is what I'm trying to say there's two ways to appear in court by General appearance just show
up they call out your name you walk up
they say state your name and address for the record sometimes they say that sometimes they don't care and you say my
name is David Lester straight and he looks at his paper and it's got the all caps name and it says David Lester
straight he just heard what you said even though you meant the man the lower up upper and lower case
name he can't distinguish that from what he has on his
paperwork so he presumes your general appearance
and then they fry you Court Marshal you and hang you or whatever they do to you doesn't matter find you do whatever they
want because you've accepted jurisdiction you've given them your consent as a citizen a person and a
resident the legal definition of a resident is someone there temporarily to do
business putting you firmly in their jurisdiction
okay the presumption of govern government acting in two roles as executive and
beneficiaries didn't I say the judge pretends to be the executive and the prosecutor pretends to be to the
beneficiary making you the trustee here it is the ninth presumption
of court is a presumption of government acting in two roles as executive and
beneficiary and for that matter at hand the private barg Guild appoint the judge the magistrate in the capacitor of
executive while the prosecutor Act in the capacity of beneficiary of the trust for the current matter unless this
presumption is openly challenged in other words you walk in with your Express trust in
hand to demonstrate you are both a guardian or general executive of the
matter trust before the court or the trustee having fiary responsibility the
presumption shall stand and you are by default the trustee therefore must obey
the the rules of the executive judge magistrate so the trustee obeys the
rules of the executor now see in my trust I make God
the executive I obey his rules I'm the trustee my heirs are the
beneficiaries which removes anybody else from being able to that's right because you've already named you because I've
named him and I've walked in with my Express trust in him then the judge can't be the executive he can't the
prosecution can't be the beneficiary number 10 is a presumption of the executive desant
tort this is a very interesting law the presumption of executive desant
tort that presumption is a presumption that if the accused does not seek to
assert their rights as executive and beneficiary over
their body mind and soul they are acting as an executive deont tort or a false
executor I challenging the rightful judge as
executive therefore the judge magistrate assumes the role of true executive and
has the right to have you arrested detained fined or forced into a psychiatric evaluation unless this
presumption is openly challenged by not only asserting one's position
and questioning if the judge or magistrate is seeking to act as executive
dantor see we should ask the judge are you acting as executive desant
tort yes or no get an
answer you just better never be in that position the presumption stands and a judge or magistrate of the private bar
Guild May seek to assistance of Bays or sheriffs to assert their false claim
upon you number 11 the presumption of
incompetence is the presumption that you are at least ignorant of the law therefore incompetent to represent
yourself or present yourself and argue properly therefore the judge magistrate
as executive has a right to have you arrested detained fined or forced into a
psychiatric evaluation unless this presumption is openly challenged to yeah how many law
classes they give you unless this presumption is openly challenged to the fact that you know
your position as executive and beneficiary and act actively rebuke and object to any contrary presumptions than
it stands by the time of pleading that you are incompetent then the judge or
magistrate can do what they need to keep you obedient keep you
obedient what is a misdemeanor that that means your attitude is bad and you're at Miss a
misdemeanor is having a bad attitude you're not
obedient all right number 12 the presumption of guilt is the
presumption that as it is presumed to be a private business meeting of the bar Guild you are guilty whether you plead
guilty or not plead or plead not guilty
therefore unless you either have previously PR prepared an Affidavit of Truth and motion to dismiss with extreme
prejudice onto the public record or call a Demmer
deir then the presumption is you are guilty and the private bar Guild can hold you until a bond is prepared to
guarantee the amount the guild wants to profit from
you this is why I save this verse Saturday afternoons because it ought to piss you
off so write out of canon law canon law regulates the courts because it
regulates trusts that's why the judge is called your honor that's why it's the first hat he has to wear this is why
it's the first jurisdiction that he has to adjudicate this is why it's the
highest form of law the air is above the land which is above the water
because of this is the reason we all get screwed and they do it through the
doctrine of parents patre where they have your jurisdiction right from the
get-go the state is your
parent so right out of canon law they explain the 12 presumptions of court and
if those 12 presumptions aren't rebutted they stand as a private bar
Guild matter and they can do whatever they want to you see in every area of the country I
travel it could be a honky like me a farm boy in a logging town from Oregon speak one way or go down to the South
and speak a little bit of French as occasions or up in the Northeast and speak differently and in Boston speak
differently and all over the country speak speak differently but the law does not speak differently in the law there are
dictions which are words the words we use determines the jurisdiction or the
right law under which we stand which is the right law Land Air or
water at that given time you have to be very careful in your hearing in a
courtroom you they'll they'll go from one
jurisdiction to the last one pretty fast they'll go through the jurisdiction the
eror almost immediately if you don't walk in with an Express trust and hold
it up and declare it and say who the trustee is who the executive is who the beneficiary is so la is land
air and water three separate jurisdictions
each has their own
words you have to be cognizant of the words that they use at that given time
if they're talking about an executive or fiduciary or
trustee or beneficiary they're operating right now he's got his honor hat on and
he's operating in the jurisdiction of the air if he's talking about parties and and contracts and this and that he's
talking about the jurisdiction of the water if he's talking about property and equity and rights
and he's he's in the jurisdiction of the land and you got to be able to follow that while you're in court and match him
with words that pertain to that jurisdiction the minute you mix
jurisdictions he's got you now you could mix jurisdictions in how you present it because you can
take your all Cap's name this is what we're talking about right okay you can
take your all Cap's Name Your Vessel and you can accept the property ownership of the
ship and place it upon the land you could place the operation of the ship in
a trust and you can trademark The Vessel you can combine all three
jurisdictions by doing that and protecting that vessel in all three
jurisdictions of the law the more you're protected in all three jurisdictions and you have the burden of
proof with you the express trust the superior
titles your patents and trademarks and copyrights and so on your
contracts now there's nothing left for him to adjudicate this is the key to
winning so you're just stopping it before it even starts you're stopping it before it gets started
right I mean what happens if you reject a summons right off bat you get a summons in the mail hey a core you go
your offer to contract is not accepted and it's date time stapped and it's sent back within this period of time and it's
filed in the court case you ran down you recorded with a County recorder and you shoved it in the
court case at the courthouse within 72 hours what if you missed it what if it
was four days later right five days later you miss a 72-hour window and they send you a
little letter that says hey we're not kidding here appear in court here's the summons if you don't appear we're going
to send out a war rant pick you up right do it again your
offered a contract is not accepted right even so even if you
missed it right but you can do it another way too so this is what I was going to finish up today with is dynamic
negotiations what does the word dynamic mean in the law it means to keep things moving keep
it moving let's roll it along keep it moving that's what dynamic means
negotiation means to go back and forth so they send you a document in the
mail says this and this and this and this and this accusing you of
something and you want to open Dynamic
negotiations so you got whoever sent you the letter usually some attorney
somewhere acting as Government lying his ass off assuming you did something
wrong and you over here and your job is to go back and
forth with him and keep things moving as long as something is in under
negotiation there's nothing to adjudicate you don't have to go to
court you're going back and forth with them that's how attorneys keep things rolling that's how attorneys keep things
rolling they just go back and forth the judge judge walks in he sits down and he goes have we come to an agreement
yet between you two so the game has come to an agreement right so he States
this you did something wrong what you job is to do is to rake that document
for statements get out a yellow pad write down all his statements write them
down okay he made that statement and he made that statement and he made this
statement and then you write him a letter back and you go all right Mr
attorney you said this I accept accept that statement
if qualifier big if in here always if
you can prove to me that you have the authority to make that
claim through your oath of office I accept this if you can prove
that I'm subject to the statutes as an employee of government
see I'm pting them in a corner yeah I'll accept this
statement if you can
prove that I am subject to the doctrine of parents
patre I'll accept this statement if you can prove I owe that tax
amount where's the certified audit I accept this statement if and then
pretty soon he sends you a letter back and he says well forget this statement I can't prove
that one and forget this one I can't prove this one but forget this one I
can't prove this one but let's talk about this one and this one and maybe adds two or three more okay so you rake
the second document for statements and you say okay Mr attorney
attorney I accept this if you can
prove that I'm not a state National and have limited diplomatic
immunity I don't care what you throw in there your job is to
pin them [Music]
into a situation that they can not get out
of and you eliminate everything that they
said because all they're doing is what presuming your
status assuming you did something wrong you get trying to get your tased
agreement that you'll show up by General appearance see and then they're using
hearsay or ship made this whole thing is ship made up
okay to try and convict you so you just ex rate their documents
for statements accept them if they can
prove this and you just start Dynamic Communications and pinning them into a corner three or four letters
down it's over with it never even goes to court I have a document on here it's
called marriage the contract that binds you really good document to read
okay here it is all right I promised you guys I would go
over the parts to a lawful contract eight parts to a lawful
contract right what are they an attorney will
tell you there's only three they do that on purpose okay there's one of these parts
they don't even want to tell you about because they'd lose a ton of
money first parties competent to contract the very first element of a
contract is having parties competent to contract the parties to contract should
be competent being of the age of consent of sound mind not disqualified from
Contracting by any law to which he or she is subject a flaw in capacity may be
due to minority lunacy idiocracy drunkenness or dissimilarity of any kind
the party should be of the same kind being either legal Fiction actors or natural living men and women allowing
more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds and their respective
jurisdictions number two free and genuine consent there must be free and
genuine consent the consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine the consent of the party
should not be obtained by misrepresentation fraud undue influence coercion or mistake if the consent is
obtained by any of these means and the contract is not valid or legally
enforceable y number three is full disclosure when
negotiating a contract full disclosure is the step of providing all material information or telling the whole truth
about any matter which may influence the decision maker of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into
a contract if either party fails to make full disclosure the contract is null and
void so that means
my number four valuable consideration the consideration is something of value
possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table this something of value is
bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance the parties
must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment what do you mean each suffer a
compromise I it's a compromise if I got to come up with money that's a
detriment but I get a benefit so yeah to be enforcable a contract must have
valuable consideration a a contract is enforceable if it has insufficient or
unequal consideration without agreement certainty of terms the terms
and conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon and must be certain and fixed any subsequent
variation of the terms must be agreed upon in other words they can't change
it like yours did that's number five that was number uh five number six
meeting of the minds a meeting of the minds a consensus ad item occurs between the parties when
they recognize each other understand their Mutual obligations and agreeing a
meeting of the minds occurs between living men women in lawful matters under common law jurisdiction and between
legal Fiction actors in legal matters admiralty Maritime jurisdiction
a contract must be either lawful or legal if one party to a contract makes a
signature as an accommodation party to a legal fiction person while the other
party makes an autograph for a living man or woman the parties are of unequal
kinds and the contract is known
void autographs or signatures is number seven lawful written contracts between
living men and women must carry the wedding autographs of the parties comprising living identification such as
a thumb print but more often living standing is recognized by an unambiguous declaration
with a handwritten wet ink autograph including the prefix by and or the words
all rights reserved or without prejudice written below legal written cont
contracts between legal Fiction actors must carry the wedding signatures of the
parties as an accommodation from a man or a woman in other words the man or the woman is a
signatory for The Vessel number eight one of my
favorites privity of contract a contract exists only between
the parties no third party can obtain rights contained within a contract or buy or
sell a contract without the express permission of the original
parties so you go to the doctor and you run up a medical bill and all of a
sudden a collection agency calls you he went into the hospital he bought the medical bill for 40 cents on the dollar
and he calls you up and says you owe ABC collection company and I go did you pay
off my debt at the hospital thank you very much I really
needed it this time it's been a real hardship being sick and being in the hospital thank you very much I really
appreciate it but between you and I there is no privity of
contract and it's over with yeah I really
do send him a thank you card appreciate it really really needed that at this
time that's the eight elements of a contract so you you email me and I'll
send it to you okay what I'm trying to tell you is
this I spent about 35 years of my Liv learning the law about 50 Years Learning
history I read a lot I read fast and I read every
day and the reason I put on these seminars is to consolidate time frames
to teach you as much as I can as quick as I can so that you can take the information and go be free and then you
can go fishing because if you spend the hours that I put in you're going to waste your whole freaking
life I could have been fishing
what's that o00 okayI hope you uh feel like you got your money's worth yesterday um we covered a lot of
information I when I went back to the room I got man we went through we went through a
lot of stuff you know that's hard to absorb that much stuff I know that it's very difficult to absorb that much
information at one time we covered about a days and a half's worth yesterday
worth the information it just flowed really well I appreciate that that your questions help keep me on track and you
guys uh you guys did a very good job with that this was a little thing I wanted to
go over with you and it has to do with the marriages we talked about yesterday
with the blueprint of a marriage and uh this was dered from a
conversation an enlightening conversation with the marriage license bureau of Arizona
okay about 20 years ago my former wife filed for divorce we had seven children
five daughters and two sons our youngest at the time our second son was 5 years
old at the time I prepared a counter claim to the petition for dissolution
her attorney filed in domestic relations court I met one afternoon with the head
of the Maricopa County superior court marriage license Bureau in downtown Phoenix the marriage license bureau was
headed by a young woman of about the age of 25 I asked her to explain to me the
general and statutory implications of the marriage license she was very cooperative and
called in an assistant a tall black man who at the time was working on an operations manual for internal
departmental use she deferred for most technical explanations to her assistant
he walked through the technicalities of the marriage license as it operates in Arizona he mentioned that marriage
licensing is pretty much the same in the other states but there are a few slight differences here and there one
significant difference he mentioned was that Arizona was one of eight western states that are community property
States the other states are common law States including Utah with the exception
of Louisiana which is a Napoleonic Code
State yeah they're under the Napoleonic Code Louis Louisiana when I go down
there and work on cases it's a whole different
thing pretty much pretty much
yeah he then explains some of the technicalities of the marriage license he said first of all the marriage
license is a secular contract between the parties and the state the state is
the principal party in the contract the husband and wife are secondary or inferior parties the secular contract is
a three-way contract between the state as principal and the husband and wife as the other two legs of the contract just
like the blueprint yesterday he said in the traditional sense a marriage is a covenant between
the husband and wife and God but in a secular contract with the state reference to God is a dotted line and
not officially considered included in the secular contract at all exactly like
the blueprint of a marriage on the United States patent and trademark office
okay he said if the husband and wife wish to include God as a party in their
marriage that is a dotted line they will have to add in their own minds the
state's marriage license is strictly secular he said he he said further that what he
meant by the relationship to God being a dotted line meant that the state regards any mention of God as irr
IR relevant even meaningless in his description of the
marriage license contract the related one other dotted line he said in a
traditional religious context marriage was a covenant between the husband and wife and God with husband and wife
joined as one this is accomplished with a recording in a family bible with three Witnesses where do you think I came up
with this stuff right I don't I don't just invent things
okay I research I find it I figure it out and then I present
it this is not the case in the secular Realm of the st's marriage license con contract the state is the principal or
dominant party the husband and wife are merely contractually joined as business
partners not in any religious Union okay they may even be considered
he said connected to each other just by a dotted line the picture he was trying to paint
was out of a triangle with the state at the top and a solid line extending from the Apex the state down the left he has
dis I didn't even find on the United States patent and trademark office website the patent of a marriage until
long after this years after this he was describing it to a te and then I found
it and I go oh my gosh here it is it's
patented it's it's a patented
process just drives me crazy
okay the dotted line merely showing that they consider themselves to have entered into a religious unit of some sort is
irrevelant to the state marriage license secular contract
diagram state is primary in the party the husband wife is secondary in the
party he further mentions that this religious overtone is recognized by the state by requiring that the marriage
must be Solomon IED either by a state official or by a minister of religion
that has been deputized by the state that's why the the preacher has to
get licensed by the state to perform a marriage he's deputized by the
state which makes him an agent right well go ask your Bishop if you can
get married in the temple without a state license tell me what he says no the answer is no I know know
that okay that's because they've commercialized
um goes back to the attorney running the church
okay so the minister of religion that has been deputized by the state to perform the marriage ceremony and make
make a return of the signed and executed marriage license back to the state so it's his responsibility to
return it's signed by him as agent again he emphasized that marriage is a
strictly secular relationship so far as the state is concerned and because it is
looked upon as a privileged business a privileged business
Enterprise so you just go into business with your wife when you marry her with the state right
yeah various tax advantages and other political privileges have become
attached to the marriage license contract that have nothing at all to do with the marriage as a religious Covenant or a bond between God and a man
or a woman by way of reference if you would like to read a legal Treatise on
marriage one of the best is a book called principles of community
property by William D fiac at the outset he explains the
community property law descends from the Roman civil law through the Spanish codes dating as far back as 600 AD
written by the Spanish jurus consulates in the civil law the marriage
is considered to be a for-profit venture or a profit making Venture even though
it may never actually produce a profit in operation and and as a wife goes out to the local market to purchase food
stuffs and other supplies for the marriage household she is replenishing the stocks of the business Andor its
inventory to restate in the civil law the marriage is considered to be a business
venture moreover as children come into the marriage household the business venture is considered to have borne
fruit now back to the explanation by the Maricopa County superior court marriage
bureau's Administrative Assistant he went on to explain that every contract
must have consideration the state offers consideration in the form of the actual
license itself the piece of paper the certificate of marriage the other part
of the consideration by the state is the privilege to be regulated by your
statutes aiv at by your stat by their statutes yeah
being isn't that a privilege once you change your status
you can resend your contracts I actually have a document that I used for myself
to anal the state of Nevada because that's where I got married so I took the state out of the contract he added that
this privilege to be regulated by the statute includes all related statutes and all court cases as they are ruled on
by the courts and all statutes and regulations into the future in the Years following the commencement of the
marriage he said in a way the marriage license contract is dynamic or or
flexible what did we talk about the word dynamic means yesterday in the law to keep moving just keep moving so it's
flexible it keeps moving everchanging contract as time goes along even though
the husband wife doesn't real ize that my thought on this is that it can really
be considered a true contract as one beomes aware of the failure by the state to make full disclosure of the terms and
conditions but remember in court presumption and assumptions so must be repudiated in all aspects or you give
over jurisdiction a contract must be entered into knowingly intelligently
intentionally and with full informed consent otherwise technically there is no
contract but you go tell try telling the court that when you're a citizen
right take could care less the marriage license contract with
the state is a contract of adhesion a contract between two
disparate unequal parties again a flaw contract such a contract with the state
is said to be a specific performance contract act as to the Privileges duties and responsibilities that are
attached consideration on the part of the husband and wife is the fee paid for the application and the implied
agreement to be subject to the state statutes rules and regulations in all court cases ruled on regulated to
marriage law family law children and property so the minute you fill out the
application and pay the fee you just bound yourself to the state statutes
rules regulations all court cases relating to marriage law family law
children and property away yeah yeah they took away
your unable rights and gave you Privileges and bound you to their
contract just by going down and paying the fee and filling out the application and getting married when you could have
took the family bible you could buy a deset Industries for 40 bucks
recorded on the first few pages take aan copy of it write a little
affidavit and go record it on the county recorder's office and you're just as
legally married but now not with the state but with you your wife and God
that's a proper way to get married that's the way we got married for hundreds of years before
this whole system of fraud came into effect
now you know you you you really need to anal the
state for the fraud that they committed for the cause of Fraud and swindle no full and honest disclosure
right and then get married the right way in the Bible go record it okay yeah if
you go back in uh like family search or ancestry.com or
one of the other genealogy programs and you go back and you search records like
1600s 1700s you'll see everybody recorded it with the church in the
family B in the Bibles of the church records and then it was recorded and you
can pull up those recordings even today from 1620 so how would you do like the
the ceremony or whatever do you have somebody marry you or can you just
exchange vows or like how does it work you can do it however you want to do it it's between you and your husband and
God make the decision get on your knees and pray about it there's no set
way people fall into a you record the event in the Bible you get some
witnesses who attended who were there they could be family members and then just go record it but do it a little
onepage affidavit just re agreeing on the event in the affidavit
go get it notorized attach it to the photo scan picture of the
Bible where you recorded it the Bible is the law it's public law 97
280 passed by Congress that the Bible the word of God this country was founded
on Christian principles and it is law Congress declared the Bible it uh passed
in 198 82 took him that long in fact 1983 was declared the year
of the Bible okay and had a presidential
declaration that 1983 was the year of the Bible
so and then the temple marriage stands there's nothing you have to do with that
correct because you're resending Pi that up with your Bishop because these
guys are run by attorneys now they have been corrupted Joseph Smith even said
they were going to be they are and they're run by attorneys attorneys control this world and we have
to stop that this is who we're or with is the bar association okay I don't know I don't
think Council of the 12 is voted on by the people of the church
there's no vote there by the people if there was you could say wait a minute what does he do for a living he's a bar
member uhuh we ain't voting him in but you have no say in it look children are
yours they're your gift from God they're your responsibility I don't care if you don't change your status God gives you
the ultimate right okay remember I said God's laws are superior constitutions
and treaties are Supreme everything else is Corporate bylaws or or as I like to call it
SMU yeah even even our prophet in in DNC
98 said it cometh of evil I mean are you righteous or not go
obey all those statutes they tell you to and then tell me if you're righteous about it no you're you're taking away
someone by your obeyence you're taking away your own and everyone else's
Freedom you get that you're actually contributing as a society to deprive
people of their rights and their freedom when you obey the statutes now am I telling you to go out
there and break the law and get tickets and write on them your offer to
contracts not accepted yes a little bit I am
but you got to know how to do it see otherwise I don't want you in jail I
don't want cops kicking the crap out of you like they do most people and knock them down on the
pavement kneel on their neck okay or shoot what I'm telling you is be
nice about it educate everybody and then let's just start saying wait a minute
legislature this statute does not fall in line with the
Constitution therefore it is null and void and we the people will ignore it
with impunity okay in this regard children born to the contract regarded as the
contract bearing fruit he said it is virtually important for parents to understand two doctrines that became
established in the United States during the 1930s the first of these doctrines is parents
patre the second Doctrine is in local parentis you know what in local parentis
means crazy parenting crazy parenting that's what it
means and that's a Doctrine in our law where the state is the parent and it's
crazy parenting parents patre means literally the parent of the country or to State it
more bluntly the state is is the undisclosed true parent of the
child isn't that a basis of Communism what's that the foundation of Communism
well of course it is communism fascism yeah start with a Lincoln he was a
follower of Carl Marx Carl Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto in
1848 okay start looking at Lincoln's first five runs as president when tried
to be president he failed five times before he finally became president on on his sixth and it might be I don't
remember I think I thought it was five and then six time he became president but it wasn't until the big Bankers of
Boston New York Chicago and Philadelphia got behind him and they put $7 million into his campaign $7 million in
1850 oh our presidential campaigns now are in the billions of dollars okay 7
million in 1850 was a lot of money do you know how much his opponent
had five You' listen to my ding videos 5,000 bucks so Lincoln's name was
hanging on signs from every railroad car every
bridge across roadways he just plastered the nation at that time which
wasn't nearly as big as it is now but he plastered ER his name on everything and people
finally voted for him but if you go back to the his early runs this presidency
and you look at letters and journals of people who lived during the time they talk about him passing helping
to pass communistic laws in the state of Illinois which is where he was
from and they didn't want the Communist son of a buck as president and it said
that in a lot of letters the people people wrote they did not want him as
president of the United States but what are we taught in our
history books honest a cannot tell alive little kids getting up on stage in
Primary School four score and seven years ago they do the whole Abe thing
it's all about freedom and slavery I got a letter the President Lincoln wrote in my PowerPoint presentation that says he
would never have freed to sleep have it been up to him in point the Emancipation
Proclamation did not F the slaves any place they were slaves
right
right had he not been shot he might have accomplished more things which then we would now be able
to blame him for it you know but it took year presidents after
him lots of them all the way between him in 1861 through
63 and 1933 it took a whole bunch of things
happening little acts of Congress little things happening laws being passed that
created this whole system of Fraud and it all happened in that period of
time now we added to it in 1945 in December we added to it in 1947 again
and we added to it in 1975 again and so on and so forth we made it
worse but during that period of time that's where most of this crap
happened think about your grandfathers living during
that period of time they'd write something in the newspaper in New York City and two
months later read it in San Francisco by then it already taken place
how how do they object to something that was printed in the newspaper and then already done within
30 days one it's 30 Days Later by the time they even know about it and we were
spreading West we were spreading thin all over this country and so our
grandfathers didn't have what I call much of ability to
rebut if any if any and so what did they do power breeds power and
Corruption and so they just added to things and gained power at incredibly
fast rate and now since then we you know we had World
War II we've had Korea Granada I mean Panama I mean Iraq war after war after
war after war after War Vietnam all of them all these all these Wars all these
uh besides World War II United Nations authorized
conflicts who the heck's got the time to rebut all this stuff well now it's time
this is what I'm trying to do is wake up a nation and you guys all go let's
handle it together right I really want to check with the state department again
and see how many of us there are but I I did get a little notice last month that
said that number the numbers in the last couple of months the last
quarter was huge the amount of people that are rejecting their
citizenship is huge and is the basis of the US jumping from the the UN and you
know being Sovereign is that based on the percentage of US Nationals well it
certainly helps because we're declaring that we have rights that we control
government the more we show president he gets those reports Mike Pompeo at the state
department meets with the president he gives them those reports and says hey look you know last quarter 40,000 people
jump maybe we ought to do something about this President Trump's going
yes he is see he knows so just a
question do do you know if all the states I can't imagine somebody saying hey let's let's organize our state and
make it so that we own everybody all the children that we own them that they're the lord of the state is there any state
that just kind of rebu against them well let me talk about a couple of States Alabama through the 10th
Amendment Society because of me talking in front of the 10th Amendment society and talking about this right here they
took it to their legislature and ran with it I didn't have any part of that other than giv the initial you know fuel
to the fire and they took it around with it now Alabama doesn't issue State marriage licenses they say record it in
a Bible bring it to the Probate Judge at the courthouse he'll take care of it he'll get it recorded on the land he'll
sign off on it so you just submit it he signs off of it it gets recorded with
the county that's all you need use a signature or do you need to seal as well or well they yeah they I don't know they
they they went through their own legislature and passed the law with the
process of how they're wanting to do it and it doesn't involve the state marriage license
Okay Oklahoma look at what the Indians just did in Oklahoma did you hear about
that no oh yeah they they just back a whole ton of land more than half the
state of Oklahoma is is an Indian Reservation
more than half and on the other half that isn't no police officer has any
authority over a Native American see the problem was these Indians were going off the reservation
going into town and getting drunk causing problems and the sheriffs were beating his out of them and keep them in
jail with no due process of law I got one Indian friend who has been
fighting the state of Oklahoma for a long long time three four years
legally and he he keeps winning he just keeps winning he goes in town he gets beat up sues him and he wins and he's
been doing that over and over again now they can't even touch him they have to refer him to the Tribal
Police right so oh man they were those sheriffs down
there were treating those guys like crap not only that what's even worse is the child protective services stealing the
Indian children so did you ever watch the movie Wind River I suggest you watch it look at the
end credits and what it says at the very end of that movie because they've had no
system to determine how many Indian children and young women and even
young men who have gone missing okay parents patry literally means the parent
of the country this means the parents May raise their children and maintain custody of their children children as
long as they don't offend the state but if they in some manner
displease the state the state can step in at any time and
exercise its Superior status and take custody and control of its children the
parents are only conditional caretakers thus the doctrine of in local
parentis how do that make you feel the mother's the tug tug is a baby out to seea and it's
presumed Dead and Lost after its soulplate is been taken till it comes back and claims its
minor estate or until you stand up and fight okay he also added a few more
technical details the marriage license is an ongoing contractual relationship with
the state technically the marriage license is a business license allowing
the husband and wife in the name of the marriage to enter into contracts with third parties and contract for mortgages
and debts they can get car loans home mortgages and installment debts in the
name of the marriage because it is not only a secular Enterprise but is looked upon by the state as a privileged
business Enterprise as well as a for-profit business Enterprise the
marriage contract acquires property throughout its existence and over time it is hoped that it increases in value
this goes to legal term limited conditional title or lease the right to make a profit or to incure a
loss I say that in all my videos to make a profit or incure a loss that's what
you have the right to do in your marriage now a lot of times you just go on dates you like her you should just
write a check and buy her a house cuz that happen
all right it's a business anyway no I'm
kidding not really so at the end of this one hour
long meeting I somewhat humorously asked if other people would come in and ask the question I was asking has anybody
else came in and asked the questions that I was asking the assistant replied that in the
many years that he had worked there he was not aware of anyone else asking these questions he added that he was
very glad to see someone interested in the legal implications of the marriage license and the contractual relationship
it creates with the
state that's the problem we're just kind of grow up going along believing and
taught to comply to not stand up and question anyone we're just told hey this is how
you do it go apply for a marriage license go right down here you know get married in a church or justice of the
peace or whatever but you got to get that State marriage license to do it get married in the temple but you got to get that state license to do it and so we
just run down and get that state license and we pay the fee and we go about our lives thinking we're
free but what did we just legally do to ourselves
we Shackled ourselves
sure his boss the young woman marriage bureau department head stated if you
have to understand that people who come in here to get a marriage license are in heat the last thing they want to know is
technical legal and statutory implications of the marriage license I hope this is helpful
information to anyone interested in getting more from familiar with the contractual implications of the marriage license the marriage license as we know
it didn't come into existence until after the Civil War and it didn't become standard practice in all the states
until after 1900 becoming firmly established by 1920 in effect the states
or governments appropriated or usurped the control of marriages in secular form
and in the process declared common law application to marriages abrogate
look if you write down the event the time the
date the place who the parties are and I would call them a mate and a helpmate as it
does in the Bible Australians at least got that part
right that took you guys just a a little long must be Sunday morning
um yeah write them down as a mate and a helpmate not a husband a wife a mate and a
helpmate that's what we really are to each other record the event get the names
down get it recorded who officiated it and a couple of witnesses that showed
up at your marriage at your wedding put that down in the Bible take a photograph
of it so it's scanned in nice print it off do a onepage affidavit
and go record it and it's every bit is legal didn't cost you much more if
probably less a good family Bible is about 40 bucks a DI right and those are the ones with the
extra pages in the front and the back so you can record your children's
births probates desks everybody in your family you can record it there any
Christian Bible see this is the thing uh Congress declared the 1611 King James
version of the Bible as the word of God that doesn't mean any subsequent printings aren't as well however if you
look at a lot of these new Bibles man has corrupted them so badly
it's not even funny I always go back to the 1611 version I've got it on my iPad
I've got it on my phone download the app in fact you can download the app with
all the macbes and the additional books that we took out of the basement of the
Vatican about uh 19 that was about
1994 we took those out of the basement of the Vatican I have a question about adoption so we originally got married
not really for getting married because he was going to adop my old son and we
have through that process but is there a way we want the only reason
in our process today that you adopt through the state is so that you can
declare the fruit see it's like if I take apples from Oregon and I drive into California
with a box of apples in my back seat they stop me at the border and ask if I got any fruit to declare that's all
you're doing is declaring your fruit without adoption with the
state in reality see you're talking about your child and
him adopting it okay you write a contract with each other put it in the Bible record the
event go record it what about do an affidavit claiming I am the
father okay son's biological father then tell the
state yeah I'm serious who are they in anyway a corporation located in
Washington DC Mr St when when a child was in public
school does that mean that they're in school's jurisdiction and what I mean is
when weing tears weing repeated reports of children being taken off of school
premises always Friday afternoon parents rushing to the courthouse finding it having wait till Monday morning2 hours
case when they took my kid six kids in 1989 DHS took my
kids no they took them out of a hospital out of a
hospital my 2-year-old son had got in a garage with the babysitter while I was
at work and he had spilled some gasoline on himself I had a lawn mower out there
Lawn Equipment chainsaws a little gas cans and he had spilled some gas on himself that door by the way was between
my kitchen and my garage with a couple steps down the that house that I lived
in at that time the laundry room was literally in the garage off to one side so she had gone in there to do some
laundry and left the door open I knew she had to go in there and do laundry I
installed a deadbolt on that door the door had a glass window in it and I put a sign on
the window that says keep this door locked at all times so I did my part
and I went to work had to work for a living come home Friday night little
sign says your son Christopher got in the garage he spilled some gas on himself
I'm not sure if he drank any so we rushed him to the hospital so I drive 100 miles an hour across town to the
hospital I get over there I walk in I start inquiring about my kids and I'm
noticing that the girl I'm talking to is kind of looking over my shoulder every once in a while so I turn around and
there's two police officers standing behind me so I walk over and said hey I need your help I'm trying to find my
kids she isn't giving me any information I want to know where my kids are at and as I'm talking to them I look
over their shoulder out the front windows of the hospital and I see him
I'm watching my kids being loaded in a white van so I push them out of the
way and I went chasing the van through the parking lot of course I couldn't catch them
but that's exactly what happened they can take them from anywhere because they
the state claims to be the parent so I do I have a one-page
document that I tell people that tape four or five copies on the back side of their door at their house and if a cop
shows up or a CPS Agent shows up they can tear one off hand it to them through the door lock the door deadbolt behind
them let them read it and then they'll leave okay but we should also have them in our car we should take them to the
school the day one hand one to the school nurse have one to the superintendent hand one to the principal
hand one to every one of their teachers and let those put those people
on notice no one talks to your
children ever they don't talk to your children
unless it's to educate them but for no government mental reason
no Authority reason are they to even talk to your children the only thing they're supposed
to be there to do is teach them English and math my opinion not very
well they shouldn't even be there yeah well they they shouldn't even
be there okay it's our responsibility and they've been laxed in and they're not doing a good job so let me that
brings up a great point I'm going to talk for just a
minute 1951 they paraded if you could picture
in your mind a school teacher the perfect school teacher little old lady school teacher if you could close your
eyes and say this is the sweetest lady who knows everything who could teach my
kids that picture in your mind would be Jane Spalding Jane Spalding
United States government paraded her around to all 50 states between 1951 and
1953 educating the states and selling them on standardized
education so that a student going to school in Los Angeles if their parents moved to New York in the middle of
school year they can move over there and fit right in right same curriculum same
testing same everything but it was also on the opice that the
schools would get Federal money right before that it was state run
schools so the idea was that when all the states
signed on to this James Spalding would be the head of the Department of Education for the United States
government and as this perfect school teacher she would make sure your children were getting the best
education possible and she truly was
perfect on April 11th 1953 the 50th state signed on to the
program and James Spalding became the head of the Department of Education 49 days later the president of
the United States at that time fired her and put Nelson aldrige Rockefeller
in as the head of the Department of Education at his acceptance speech which
was a very famous speech there were a room full of
reporters cameramen and they asked him some questions one was Nelson how much money
did you make last year he said $140 million 1953
he was a grandson of one of the most prominent banking families in the
world he made $140 million they said how much did you pay in taxes and he reached
in his pocket and he grabbed out a penny which at that time they were Indian Head pennies and he flicked it into the
audience and he says not one red scent and today he would have been
hammered for that being a racist statement right not one red sent and that line became famous
and they said Nelson if you made $140 Million last year why would you take this position and only paid at that time
I think it was 37,000 or something a yearly salary as a head of the
Department of Education 37,000 was a lot of money in that
time okay the average house was about 2500 bucks
okay and he said because I consider it the most important position in all of
government hands went up flash balls went off they said you mean you consider
a greater position than the president and the vice president of the United States and he looks at him and says
absolutely I do because if you give me one decade one generation and I'll
change the minds and therefore the direction of the world I'll change the mind and therefore
the direction of the world and he did eight years later not even a decade
eight years later every textbook in our
schools were changed to lies now that wasn't the first revision
go back to 1908 when the Jackal Island and the Federal Reserve started to come
into play and and things started changing in back then they changed at that time as
well our textbooks changed on the state level state by state they all changed I
had an argument with a 20year professor of history that went on
about three months I mean we were going back and forth on the phone on emails on text
messages he had watched one of my videos now it wasn't just about him it was more about a linkoln but he' watched one of
my videos where I just hammered LA and he called me up and he said David
I think you're tell not telling the truth here I think you're telling lies and I said oh
really explain that to me and I challenged him and there's not many people that can out debate me
okay and he started talking about things and I said where did you get your information he says well out of the
textbooks I've been teaching for 25 years I said
great do you have any textbooks that are say prior to the turn of the century
1900 and before and he said no I said go see if you can find
any couple weeks went by sent him a little text hey did you
find any of those textbooks yet no I can't find any anywhere I said
keep looking couple weeks go by hey have you found any of those textbooks
yet nope this went on for three
months finally he says I had to go back and I forgot where it was Connecticut or
somewhere back in the Northeast to a family
reunion and I was walking down the street and there was a garage sale and this there was a box of books there and
it was a whole bunch of really old books and I found two history book
textbooks one from before 1900 and one from like 1902 1903 somewhere in there
and I said well what did you learn he says I learned that everything I've been teaching for 25 years is a
lie yeah he was devastated this man I mean he needed
counseling by the time he was done just devastated I mean he was ready to retire
after after just finding those two textbooks
and
anyway the only way to learn true history is to get it from the horse's
mouth read letters and journals of people who lived during the time and what did they think what did they write
to their grandmother and their neighbor and had the conversations they car carried on about old a
Lincoln read some of the letters that were written in Illinois in the
1850s and you'll get a whole new picture of the man okay and it's not just him
I'm just using him as an example history is Rewritten by the
Victor and when Nelson Alders Rockefeller became the Victor he rewrote
his history and guess who that affected me I wasn't born till 63 he had
already had this decade in place between 53 and 63 to change everything so when I
went into school everything I learned kindergarten through 12th grade was a lie pretty
much yeah fortunately I had a mother that got me interested in things like history and
genealogy and she really really taught me how to read and how to study and how to learn but reading is not reading she
also taught me it's comprehending it's searching that they're only going to put something in
one little place over here and then the next piece of the puzzle is going to be over here and the next piece of puzzle
is going to be over here and you got to find those puzzle pieces what is the key in this one set of laws what's that one
key that shows you a piece of the puzzle what is that one key over in this piece
the law that shows you the puzzle or in this book that shows you the puzzle I suggest reading the law of Nations by
vatel that's how our country was found up founded uh read The Federalist Papers
and The anti- Federalist Papers that's the arguments that they had at the conventions before the Declaration of
Independence was written do you guys know what the declaration independence says it's probably the most important
document we have there's all also the Magna Carta from 12:15 that was the one of the most
important documents because everything happens in England few hundred years before it
happens here but that's one of the most important documents is helps us to be
free okay then
read judge napalo he says the constit institutions usurp the Articles of Confederation
somebody asked me this at lunch and I said I'd talk about it tomorrow so I'm going to bring it
up with Lincoln what happened what happened with
Lincoln first of all when he finally did because of the Banker's money win the
presidency he couldn't be president did you know that he was a bar member we had other
attorneys that were presidents prior to that but he was the first bar association
president he couldn't be because he held a title of nobility he couldn't be
president see the 13 Tona amendment was put in the first
Constitution which by the way one of my grandfather's Richard Strait signed that
first constitution
and it had that 13th Tona Amendment saying that it's called I call it Tona because it's titles of nobility act no
one holding the title of nobility no Prince king queen
Esquire which is a bar member could hold the Office of the
President so what did he do when he became president he
bankrupted the original United States of America and he incorporated as a
Delaware Corporation and then he put the Grand
Army of the Republic in charge of the country and then he made himself the commander-in chief he signed executive
order number one he was the first president in history to sign an executive order within 30 days he signed
executive order number 100 100 executive orders in its first 30
days in office office executive order 100 was the Liber code it put the
country under Marshal Rule and it's never been rescinded this is why we've been flying
the war flag ever since we've been under
war and by the way women the Libra code says they're not
supposed to attack women or children so if you use the Liber code in
court as a woman things ought to go a lot easier on
you if you could find a judge that cares about that anymore
so Lincoln did a lot of things that started us on this path
of corruption so who was the hero was it
Booth was he the Patriot no
I mean you got to understand who played the right part history was written by the Victor so they just Twisted the
story they flipped it on his head do I like talking about about any of our presents no I don't how many presents do
we have prior to George Washington if you know don't
answer cuz I knew you were going to throw that you're close we had four 14
presidents prior to George Washington this country was founded in 16007 in Jamestown Virginia 1620 in
Massachusetts wasn't until 1776 that the Declaration of
Independence was written the United States of America started in
1776 what were we prior to 1776 well between 16007 and 162 20 in
the South we were under the Virginia
delegate the Virginia compact what were we in Massachusetts we were under the
Mayflower Compact starting in 1620 they arrived in Mayflower in the
Boston Harbor in November in Boston you
know how cold it is in November in Boston and they arrived and they said we're not leaving
the ship and going to shore they'd been in Sea for three months or more and they
want to get on the land really bad right but they refused to go to shore until
the Mayflower Compact was written and sign six of my grandfathers signed the Mayflower
Compact when they want to sure that first winter with no homes
built not knowing where they're going to get food other than game they could get out of the forest couldn't grow any
fruits or vegetables and sure as hell didn't bring enough with them half of the 116 people on the
Mayflower died first winter
half that is an incredible thing one of my
grandfathers had a son at Sea they named him OSI
anic Oceanic was his first name Oceanic
Hopkins there's several books written about his father his father first came
to this country would he would have been the first ship to land in Virginia before
Captain Smith but they hit a tropical storm off the southern eastern coast they capsized
and swam to Bermuda 14 of them made it out of
140 14 made it with no tools just the clothes on their back and no food they
built two rowboats and rode the 99 miles from Bermuda to the coast of Florida and then
up the coast knowing there was other ships coming to Jamestown Virginia
and when they got to jamest town Captain Smith had just arrived their ship had
been damaged so he indentured himself as a
servant slave to Captain Smith for two years in order to pay
for supplies and food and to help the 14 people that came with him two of those
died along the way and 12 made it okay
he was still indentured to Captain Smith when Captain Smith had to sail back to
England so he didn't get to remain on the shores that he loved he went back to
England during the time the captain Smith was in England is when his
indentures ran out and now he's stranded in England
with no money nothing he started a business he became a very wealthy
businessman between 16009 and 1620 and he had had three children and
got married during that time and they all jumped and his wife was pregnant and they all jumped on the
Mayflower and she had a baby at Sea named Oceanic and he was the only one that
arrived on the Mayflower with previous Indian experience and American
Experience okay and they wrote a book about him that when he got off the
Mayflower he knelt down on the sand and he
says on these Shores I shall live or die
forever that he was never ever going back to England
so that's fortitude okay the fact of the matter is we we've gone to all these years in
school and we just haven't been taught the truth not only have we haven't been taught the truth we haven't had one single law class and every day since we
got a our drivers permit we've been dealing with the
law and that's what I want to change we all have to learn enough to
stand and uh if we can do that go out there and gather people and
start teaching them we all need to put on our our own little classes we need to teach our own family and our family's
family and our friends and our grandkids how to stand up because it won't be long before I
guarantee they might take one of your grandchildren the odds are one in
five one and five child
not okay yeah knowing what I know today I would have held on to them like
this and threaten them at all cost
okay no way would they use a false and fraudulent
Doctrine to take a child from me I don't care how many guns came I'd stand there
and die and to take as many of them out as I could just to prove them wrong and
then hope somebody wrote about it to prove them wrong you know that's a key we've we got to make a stand if if our
life depends on it because it does let's write about it first so we don't have to die okay that's that's the key stand up
stand up in court stand up now P get get that warning ask me to for the warning I
should have printed one off didn't even think about it you your kids back you see that they theyed a DCS
appointment for mli's kids tomorrow absolutely I I said that the other day I
I said I I I commented on that the moment I found out yesterday morning I
commented that the next thing that's going to happen is they're coming for her kids yeah yeah I
did they're already going after our our elderly our elders okay that
that is a real sore subject with me too because I get tons of phone calls every
day from people whose parents are being abused in these
homes isolated abused uh not being allowed to visit um drugged even
killed even killed and murdered in fact I got a u a person that I've helped
quite a bit over the years and his new wife they've only been married about a year she has worked for 20 years in an
old folks home in Indiana and she was listening to me having a
conversation about this and just cried and cried and cried on my shoulder about
it she is absolutely devastated from what she's watched in the 20 years she's
been there and didn't realize I don't know why I don't know
why people don't just see it and say hey gosh that's wrong this can't happen but
she didn't realize that hospice was literally killing people in these
homes the biggest thing is opioids and morphine and
did they say
at the morphine shots are the worst she was telling
me that this uh older lady who she had
been managing for quite a few years never complained about being in
pain never complained about being in pain one one day the doctor
recommended Hospice Care over and above the care that she was already providing
in the home and from the day she went into
hospice they were giving her morphine shots and they just keep upping the dos
and uping the dose and up and the dose and within a week she was dead she'd been taking care of her five
years said she' never in 5 years complained about pain that wasn't her
issue her issue is she was losing her mind and never complained about her body
being in pain then why would Hospice use
Morphine Morphine is what you give a soldier in the field when he is shot
that's the only real purpose of morphine in in my
opinion is is a major major injury where you're in so much pain and
in the field you have to be quiet or the enemy finds
you so you can't have an injured guy that you have to haul 20 20
kilometers back to get him out of there you can't have him screaming in pain
because it'll kill your whole platoon or your whole
unit to me that's the only reason reason to use morphine and then it stops when they get
back to the medical facility there she says she also notices
that they're taking their property I have a man who retired from
the railroad but not only did he retired from the railroad his whole life he had been a
collector of trains and buses and he had over a hundred acres of
trains and buses literally all restored some of them
worth two or three million for one unit okay his estate was estimated at
the time this was 1996 it was estimated $170 Million worth of trains and buses
they used his trains and buses in quite a few movies okay he was getting paid from
Hollywood some pretty big bucks just to use his stuff because he's one of the only places they
could go to get that authentic equipment right he had two children he went to a
prominent law firm in Florida to have a trust set up for his
kids that attorney firm saw how much he was worth they paid the daughter a
17-year-old daughter of a hooker to set him up he wasn't even in the same
city and they faked it they set it up they had her testify that she had did
some awful things to him as a minor they these attorneys did this they threw him
in jail I have all the all the records I have her confession five years later
that it never happened that she never even met the man but to to strengthen in their
story they in the court case said he had touched his own kids as well that he was
this pedophile this pervert now he's in a Philadelphia prison at 80 years old he
never committed a crime he's been there since
1996 and the attorneys stole his entire estate except for about 70 million that
they didn't know about that was offshore that he didn't tell anybody but he's got about 70 million down in the Cayman
Islands that they didn't know about but everything here in America they sto he
also ran the Hebrew Foundation for America to benefit Hebrew children here
in America and he gave a lot of money to Hebrew children because that was his
Heritage and now he's in prison he's 80 years old I'd like to get him out and this Co thing came along we were ready
to all start at all this Co thing came along they shut the court case down and they isolated him in the prison we can't
get any documents signed we can't tell him what he's doing we can't get anything notorized not no it's just in
limbo since about last February
say and it's not and it's not they've got him literally in solitary
confinement shoving him a plate here here and there yeah he's 80 years old
now his kids have I have affidavit from his kids that he never did that I've I
have her affidavit when she's now 25 she wrote
the affidavit she wrote it like six or seven years later a gal named Mary found her
and got an affidavit from her that she had never did it but these are attorney firms used police officers to destroy
evidence to cover up this thing you look at the court transcripts and they denied
the evidence it's like he couldn't defend himself he put evidence into the court case no we're throwing that out
motion to suppress he couldn't even defend
himself and they stole roughly the 70 million he they knew
about fortunately he's got 70 million left if he can ever get out without dying in
there because of well right now that's what's holding us
up how do we how do we beat that like they're just pretty much taking our family members into these prisons we
can't you know see them visit them in the hospital how do we beat that how do we fight that you know my best guess is
start building The Gallows just take them down to the capital and set them up on the steps and
just leave them there say You're Next you keep messing with our rights you're
next just a notice a warning okay don't threaten anybody
personally don't name names but we got to do something I don't know what to do
I'm just close to arming up at 2: a.m. that's that's how the government trained me the 2:00
hour okay that's when everybody's
asleep I'm not saying we should cross that line we shouldn't we got to do everything we possibly can before it
comes to that if not they're going to start shooting and then it will be at that once they fire the first round it's
open season that's what they want they want that's right they want us to open the first round we can't do that that's
what I'm trying to tell you we can't do that but we got 90 million veterans in this country with firearms and they're
all buying more every day I'll be honest quite honest with you I get quite a few
Visions all the time Visions God opens things up to me
and I've seen the Civil War it's talked about in the Bible by the way and I've seen it and we have seven
years of turmoil after the Great Awakening so people are got to wake up and pretty
soon we got to stand up right now we're in the middle of waking up so this is the process of waking up right here
we're all involved in it in this room so when did the seven years of
teral me start or how it's going to start it's going to
start approximately March 18th of 2023 Gregorian calendar is not right you want
to talk about that for a minute
our calendar is not quite right we're supposed to have 13
months of 28 days with one day the day of
Resurrection Easter as a neutral day that's our 365 days we've actually got
13 constellations not 12
this same calendar is very close to the Mayan calendar but it's also very close
to several ancient Sans skript
calendars what do sep mean
seven I thought that was the ninth month what does O
mean what does nove mean what does deck
mean supposed to be the seventh 8th n9th and 10th month Jan is 11 Feb is
12 March is 13 April is our first month babies are born in the spring the 1 of
April Easter this is the start of our new year this is a start of spring when
the flowers start coming up the grass starts coming up the trees start leafing out the babies are born
that's the first day our neutral day day one the day we
rest and celebrate the Resurrection the new beginning the beginning of
Christ April is month
one and then we lost a month in there where is it what's it
called we know what it's called I'm not going to reveal it yet but we know what it's called but this is a true calendar
the Gregorian calendar is SMU ship made up by
man us out ofal to keep us out of our natural cycles we all vibrate at one of three
frequencies did you know that okay 432 Hertz is the god frequency
that's a Celestial frequency and we have a testial and a tur terestrial
frequency darn right she says that why when people are true we can feel it and
we can sense it we know that it's right you know we don't even have to research it we know we can feel it we feel it in
our bodies and our spirits and our souls and we know it's right by the way 528 Herz is the love
vibration or the DNA healing vibration by the way 528 and 633 and 432 are our
three frequencies okay so it depends on whether you're Celestial testial or
terestrial that's 60 60 what is yeah 5G what is what has our
clocks been running at 60 all of our electricity 60 we've been
under Satan for a long time this is a satanic frequency it's really Celestial
testial and terrestial believe it or not our our church teaches us is three
degrees of heaven but it's really our three frequencies our souls are energy our the energy holds our minerals
together which is our bodies our bodies are nothing more than the dust of the earth held together by energy by our
souls so anyway you can see just from this
example that our current calendar is wrong by a long ways gregan calendar is
just SMU along with statute codes policy it's all stuff
somebody just made up you know it's it's just like the what we found on the FDA
it's made over 1398 policy regulations which have become law under the
FDA and the gal that wrote them never had the authority to write
them it's she just made up and they're out there putting people in
jail for breaking her policies her
law every agency of government does that especially Child Protective
Services okay yeah so that that was that's a
little kind of fun you could draw that out I wish somebody would just go ahead and just make up our new
calendar did you know how it would work if every every day how many days of the week are there seven right seven goes
into 28 equally so if the fifth of the month was on a
Monday on every month the fifth would be on a Monday all year
long we wouldn't have to sit there and think about what day of the week is it compared to what you know what day of
the month is it right it it just become it would be natural we would just we
would learn at once and it would just come to us see div that's right Satan divides and conqu
not just divid by confusion currently it's divided and conquered all the way down to our eny right and they're doing
that that's what they're doing they're trying to bring us down from these beautiful high vibrational frequencies
and drop us down to 60 hertz is that part of vaccine AR DNA
modific about changing our D structure alter
frequencies let me tell you something do you know all these movies
about zombies I used to go oh that's just
right and then my son who's autistic designed one of his games as a zombie shoot game right I got a son that's
autistic and he's in his 20s and he designs games he sells them on the App Store uh through apple and he gets a
check for four or 5,000 a month he totally self-sufficient he has almost no V
vocabulary at all in his late 20s he sees me he runs up D D D D D like he's
18 months old his vocabulary is gone and I can tell you a long story about that
too absolutely Al how you got to get that sometime too um yeah a good Mentor that's why I
decided I would be a good Mentor it's because without him I don't
know what would have happened I got my I fought for my kids I got them back right away three days three days I had them
back by 5:00 you know what I did he told me exactly what to do so I guess I'll tell this a little short
story all right first of all after they took him from the
hospital and the cop stopped me the next morning which that night was a very bad
night I almost committed a suicide that night I had just gone through a divorce
6 months earlier I was a single dad raising six kids under the age of eight
and I just started a new business 25 miles up the freeway so I had two babysitters coming
over every day babysitters recommended to me by the
state on their list of approved babysitters
and I'd leave for work they'd show up a little before 7 every morning I'd leave for work at 700 I'd get home at 6 and
they'd go home until that one Friday night and
what I found out later is they had been covering for each other so they'd both show up then wanted
leave and go do their thing after I left and come back so they were both there when I came home
and then the next day they swap so not only were I paying two and
getting one but yeah so anyway that next morning I went to the police station the
sheriff's department actually and I told him I wanted to file a kidnapping that
my kids had been kidnapped it was a plain white van
didn't really lie to the sheriff I knew DHS it took him I
mean um but he said I can't do that for 48
hours he said just wait till Monday morning go check with dhsc I ain't waiting till Monday morning
I'm going down there on a Saturday correct but that's how they
are they got to be missing like 24 hours anyway I go down to D the
DHS and I start knocking on the door and pretty soon I see somebody way
down the hallway and I start knocking on the door until my Knuckles are bloody
finally they came to the door and they weren't much help which I knew they wouldn't be but what they said is I said
I'm here looking for my kids the straight children where are they she goes I don't
know anything about that great that's all I wanted to hear now I went back to the sheriff and I said hey
I went to DHS got a hold of somebody they don't have my
kids little FIB they don't have my kids and he says all right I'll take the
report and he took the report I didn't his attitude sucked I didn't think he was going to do anything but when he
came back out of the out with the paperwork he also brought this little white business card
and it had this guy's name on it with a phone number and it said retired and
that was it it's all it was on that card he said here call this guy he helps
people just like you anyway he took my report I knew he
wasn't going to do anything so I called him his name is Roger I'm still friends with him today
but now he's getting to the age where he's starting to lose his mind too which is sad because in 1989 he was a
genius but he was also a retired Federal prosecutor for 23 years of 23
years and he mentored me he literally stayed with me at my house all day
Saturday and all day Sunday and he told me exactly what to do he says I want you
to show up at the County Courthouse take a stack of papers with you he says I don't care what they are
are doesn't matter what they are just take a stack of papers with you and show
up at the courthouse show up early so I sat outside on the steps waiting for them to open the door and I
walked in and he says this particular Courthouse has four
courtrooms right and they're offset there's like one here one here one here and one here he says right in front of
the door of each courtroom is a bench sit on one of them put your head down
just look at your paperwork and act like you belong there so people won't question
you okay okay Roger I'll do it I'll do anything I got guts at nothing else
right so I did that and he says wait for a court to be in session each door of
this courtroom has a little tiny glass window he says look through the window
and when you see the judge sit down you get up you walk across the hall you
throw the doors open and you walk in like you own the place walk right up to the judge's stand and say I need your
help this is an emergency just like that this is an
emergency all right I need you to do me a favor judge
I need you to sign a piece of paper paper and take your Lun hour for me can
you do that oh I promise I won't take much of your time he goes what do you need me to to
sign I said just sign something that I can give to the sheriff to have him go
get the guy that I need to be here to speak with you with he's not going to
come on his own and I've already talked to the sheriff
and so the judge said what's the guy's name and by then that morning I'd had the the uh DHS worker's name so he
writes his name down he says take this down to the court CER she'll type it up all formal
like he just he just wrote down on a piece of paper took it down to the
hallway to the clerk she wrote it up I ran to the sheriff I gave him a piece of paper he
went and picked up the guy from DH CH and they both met me back at noon in fact we got there like 2 minutes late
and I was sweating bullets cuz he said be here right at
noon we walk in and he's the judge is sitting up on his chair in an empty
courtroom by himself just tapping his fingers we walk in the room he says come
on let's go in my Chambers I need to eat lunch he had actually had one of his
assistants call and order him a sandwich from down the street so he could sit there at his desk in his Chambers and
listen to what I had to say and I laid the whole thing out for him and I said
they kidnapped my kids and there was no reason I had done nothing wrong and I laid the whole story out for
him and I told them how I'd gone to the sheriff and filed the kidnapping thing and went to DHS and they told me they
didn't have them they lied to me went back to the sheriff filed the
report the judge looks over the sheriff and he goes well is that true can you cooperate that and the sheriff says yep
that's exactly what happened he looks over at the DHS office and says do you have his
children and he says yep and then he looks at me and he goes
well this is your court what do you want to have happen
here I'm 26 years old I don't know about what I'm teaching you now right I
don't know anything just what Roger told me to do and he didn't tell me that
part so the only thing I could think of was I want my kids back by 5:00 and I
want him fired and I want him
fired and the judge just kind of looked at me for a minute he said said I want
you to have his children home at his house by 5:00 and your resignation on my
desk just like that and I thought to myself does a judge have the power to fire a DHS
worker I guess he does right he just did it right in front of my face I i' never
thought that had happen see I felt so bad the next day I got a
hold of the DHS agent and I said 'I sorry I didn't mean to
make you lose your job he says kid you did me a favor I have been tired of
stealing children this long I've been there 22 years and I'm ready to
retire you just set the date and by five o'clock I had my kids
back three days they were gone out of my life and it was the worst three days of my life how
and I'm sure for them too in fact I think it messed a couple of them up
okay but that's the story of how I got my kids back and I told myself that day
no matter how much I had to work to earn a living no matter what I was doing I was still going to spend as much time as
I could helping people that's what good people do and I
just keep finding better and better ways and just keep trying to improve my classes and give you more information so
you all can help me do it I no one person or even two or three or 10 or a
hundred could do this by themselves we need lots and lots of people all across this country standing up for this we
have to stand up for our rights do you guys know what your rights even are you have many of them they're all given to
you by God in the Bible you know what your rights are and reality first is
free agency the right of self-determination you determine who you are what you are what you want to believe how you want to believe it
nobody can take that away from you when we go to war and we fight for this country we fight for that right for you
to have any religion you want believe any way you want I don't even care if you disagree with me doesn't matter I'll
fight for you to do that to have that right it's that important free agency is the most important thing we have okay if
you want to burn the flag burn the flag I'm not going to like it but you
have the right to do it okay not the correct one
anyway thank you sweetheart it's the war flag when you fly the war flag on your vehicle you fly
it in front of your house you're designated your house as a military installation and they the government can
show up anytime and come in your home you fly the Peace Flag like I do at my
house like she does at her house they can't come in your
home okay think about that we're all out there being Patriots and we're all
standing up there and everybody's flying that war flag they have no idea what they're doing most Patriots as good
people as they are as much as they love this country as much as they fought for this country and a lot of them died for
this country they don't know what they're patriotic to the Pledge of
Allegiance I look at these guys refusing to put their hand on their heart and pledge allegiance do you know who wrote
the Pledge of Allegiance or should I say who was hired to write the Pledge of Allegiance Bellamy Bellamy was a
communist hired by the government through Edward mandle House's
plan same plan he didn't bellam me was pre Edward mandle house but it was
basically the same plan it's a system of pledging to Pledge Your Allegiance to something
the only thing you should Pledge Your allegion to is your god and your family okay not a
government Flags down the window a lot of CPS
sued flag website is that a violation is it a violation no it's called a distress

to teach you all is to be suurus to be of One's Own rights to take Dominion to
stand upon your own two feet and say I'm not in distress I'm at peace leave me
alone that's what I'm trying to teach what that means is you're in
distress that's just doing exactly the opposite it was really controversial a
lot of people said that's going to cause you even more problems and there right those people are awoke they're right see
we don't realize these wonderful patriotic groups I love them with all my heart and soul because they're standing
but they don't know what they're standing to or for or why or
how and it's sad okay what about putting Z tags on

your whole face now they're wondering how to just recognize your eyes let me tell you something I'd rather be free
and stand for the right principles and be targeted than to be be a
sheep and be led to the slaughter okay those who comply are the
first the right to privacy and confidentiality free from unwarranted Invasion the right to control and hold
one's property lawfully without trespass the right to self-defense when threatened with harm loss or
deceit let me read that one again the right to self-defense when threatened with harm
loss or deceit isn't everything I've been talking about they've committed fraud
they committed fraud they committed fraud they commit fraud police officer pulls in in his car
he walks up to us he starts talking to us he's committed fraud don't put that in his I'm just telling
you okay and we have to know how to handle that that's the hardest part it's
handling things properly I don't want you in jail I
don't want you hurt or injured avoiding those bear traps avoiding the bear
traps but still standing strongly upon your two feet and not giving in even an
inch see that's a problem you give them an inch they take two you give them two they take four and so on and that's
what's been happening for 150 years enough is enough the right to do process of law
with notice an opportunity to defend I want to make it clear I am not
anti-government I am all for government president Trump is my president I
respect him more than any president I've ever served under and I've guarded two
of them two pres I've
guarded don't made me say it
the right to do process of law with notice and the opportunity to
defend the right to be Presumed Innocent suffering no detention or arrest no
search or seizure without reasonable cause without the proper due process
without the correct warrant when when arrested without being
taken immediately in front of a magistrate if you get cffs put on you
and you get thrown in the back of a car you demand immediately to go in
front of a magistrate directly don't pass go don't collect
$200 don't stop by the jail don't stop by the police station first take me to a magistrate where you
declare your innocence and chances are good
the sheriff will be taking you home and apologizing okay most of the time as
long as you're nice
okay the right to remain silent when accused to avoid self-incrimination that's a single
biggest reason people get into trouble is you can't shut the hell up when you
need to shut the hell up it's a single biggest thing you'll say
something that you think is innocent that's not going to get you in trouble
you'll honestly believe it won't get you in trouble and they'll twist it on you and get you in trouble because you
opened your mouth and said something never answer any questions your very
first words to a police officer is I don't answer any questions am I being detained am I free to go
and then leave and how theyve twisted it now is even if you have light conversation even
about fishing or anything it gives them an oblig or opportunity to explore more into what you have and even it's just
like conversation about fishing it's consent you're being chummy with the cop if you open your door and step out on
the threshold close your door behind you you've given them consent you've attempted to make
contact if you let them in your house youve given them
consent you talk to them through the door don't be rude be nice hey officer
you having a good day I hope you are but right now you're trespassing upon private
property what are you here for and he'll let him say what he's here
for okay and then say I'm sorry I don't answer any of those
questions this is your your notice you're operating under Title 18 section 242 deprive me of my rights under the
coer law have a nice day go home you let him in collect
bodies well if he comes in forcefully he's going to be leaving in a
bag in my house once I've given them a proper warning I'm not going to fire on an
officer without warning I'm going to do everything I can in my power to verbally and
nicely tell him he has no right to speak to me but as soon as he declares war and forces himself upon me he's fair
game okay do I want to kill somebody no absolutely not that's the last thing on
earth I want to do I'd like him to go home to his kids and I'm going to tell him that you got the opportunity right
now officer turn around get in your car leave go home home to your family but
come in my house deprive me of my R and you're going to leave in a body
bag I'm not going to tell him he's going to leave in a body bag that's a threat but that's exactly what I'm saying and I
think he'll get the point just from the tone of my voice and from how nice I'm
being okay I'm not telling you to go shoot
cops I love police officers many of them are my dear friends and they're good
people and I'd love them to come over and have a cup of coffee and sit down
and let me teach them what I know because once I teach them what I know they won't be writing tickets for
statute violations I can tell you that okay you know Gina's uh
son-in-law sat in her living room I taught him quite a bit about it they to
he went back to the city of Logan Police
Department and after about a week of not writing any tickets they took away his car and reassigned him to the
jail because he refused to collect
Revenue it only took me couple of hours one evening over dinner at Gina's house
you know they get that feeling they they they have these feelings all the time
like I'm just something you know then I think that's one of the reason a lot of them are pissed off all the time they
know something's wrong they know they're not something but the count the City attorney or the County Attorney if
they're in the sheriff's department comes in and trains them how to be policy enforcement Revenue collection
agents and they got quotas to fill they don't write a certain number of tickets
a month bring in a certain amount of dollars it doesn't pay their salary they got to cover their own
salary and their own cost of car their car and their uniform and all they that's how much they got to write every
month if they're not covering that they don't have a job that's but some of those guys are
covering that 10 times more so then what does the sheriff do he looks at his annual
budget he goes hm I think I got a money in here to hire three more
officers and that's what he does the next year so now more people are violated and then more money is coming
in and then he looks at his next year's budget he goes wow we can uh build a new
jail we can hire three more officers get three more cars
and this is how they expand their Authority and their deprivation on us all the
time you have police officers sure actually our County Sheriffs could
probably pretty much we wouldn't need City police
officers yeah our County Sheriffs could pretty much handle all the cities in their County
right right now our counties can operate strictly off their Investments do you
know that do you know they really don't have they could fire all the county workers except what's absolutely
necessary I thought this was funny remember back under
Obama where they couldn't come to a budget agreement and so they sent home all the unnecessary federal workers
well if they're unnecessary why do we have them in the first place give them a pink slip send them
home there's always Barber College they can go do something
else if they're not needed how many 100,000 of them went
home more than 400,000 federal employees weren't
needed were
non-essential see I'm sitting here watching the news and I'm going holy Christ
400,000 salaries and the cost of their office space and their computers and their their Suburban black Suburbans and
whatever it is they're driving we don't need them see that's how I think everybody
else is going God I hope we can get them back but you got to understand that they're
doing that through budget operation so if they don't use it they lose it so they got to burn up and spend more so
that now okay this next year when I ask for more of a budget there's a reason why I need more but then I'm going to
keep on doing the same thing over and over and over again and that's where all the blow is I have a g that used to work
for me named Julia Jones and Julia when she got out of high school she went to work for the US Forest Service
she went to work for me selling mortgages with one of my mortgage companies
because when she was with the forest service towards the end of each month
she was told to go drive around and burn
fuel well when you're just burning fuel you're also wearing Tires and Brakes and
and she'd have to go drive around the mountains and and burn fuel so that they'd get the same allotment the next
month of fuel so if they had extra fuel her job the last three days of the month
or four days of the month was to go drive around and burn
fuel part of the month they had a pingpong tournament inside the forest
service offices these guys are getting paid 50
60 70,000 a year to play Pink
PK and go burn up fuel at the end of the month and I'm going holy
crap why can't we just give them what they need when they need it and when
they don't need it God don't tell them to go burn fuel where's their common
sense see she couldn't stand it after about a
year and came to work for me in the mortgage business
so do you think with like be fund the police do you think if they stop and force some statutes and just just
enforce you know rap murder the important things
protections um yeah could actually defund a lot of the police I think a lot of the incidents that they have the
problems they have start with traffic violation or something simple what you think about that wellig
cities you yeah are there idiots out there that drive too fast yes there is but when should it
be handled if they cause an accident there should be a stiff
penalty that's when it should be handled if once a see back in the old west when
we were all wearing six years right going through town you know there was almost no crime very little crime
because if you stole the horse you got hung yeah see if you robbed a bank you
got hung if you shot somebody you got hung the penalty was so stiff most people were good honest people and they
didn't want to do it they didn't want to take that risk you know in China I go over to China and I meet with a group of
Engineers they all make 80 to $120,000 a year equivalent they live in
million dooll apartments in town they got $2,000 laptops they driving 7080 ,000 cars they
go to lunch for two hours every day in the middle of their day two hours they took a two hour lunch to break their day
up a lot of times they only they eat in about an hour and then they play
competition games with each other to Spur competition the other thing is the
owners of every business sets aside a pretty good chunk of cash every month to
take special people to launch it's a reward system system you you do good you
get to go to lunch with the boss he pays for everything and then the boss i' I I
watched $1,500 lunches with six eight people man they love Remy
Martin they love really expensive Saki and they like good
vodka and they drink those at lunch okay but the first time I went to lunch with
a group here's something I learn they drove up into their car and they
parked in a parking spot right next to a sidewalk and the sidewalk is about as
wide as this building and there's people walking I mean hundreds thousands of
people walking past this car just during the
lunch and they get out of the car they always put me in the backseat like I'm being
chauffeured and they all get out of the car and they start walking towards the building and I get out and I go wait hey
hold on a minute anybody going to roll up the windows lock the doors your $2,000 laptops are sitting right here on
the Seas they look at me like why I said look at all those people aren't you
afraid it's going to get stolen oh they said oh no no no no no no will
reach his hand in that car and I said why not they said you see all those chinan walking in front 25 of them
tackle him beat him to death hold him for the police they don't dare and if they steal
something or a finger something or something or beat them to nearly to
death they don't tolerate this they take care of their
old people they believe it's a sin for their old people to die in a hospital
they're supposed to die at home where they're comfortable with their surrounded by their family they take care of their children
they take care of their neighbors children they're good people and they all want to be Sovereign
and they know the government's communist and they know they get paid well and they know they fly down to private
islands and go gambling and they all Drive black Audi so they know when they're coming and
when they're not if you got a black Audi you're with the government nobody else will buy a black Audi because they want
to know when the government's coming okay and they just avoid him like the plue they don't talk to them
they think as long as they pay them well so they can go gambling so they can raise their family well they'll leave
them alone and they do for the most part the communist government of China
the military might of China they don't really pay much attention to
the people they pay attention to other countries what other countries are doing
and how to compete with other countries and how that's what they mainly do unless somebody is standing up against
them then they'll destroy them for sure they don't want people standing against them so when the people of China this
last year said we were going to go join The Sovereign government of
Mongolia now you got 1 million Chinese communist government military
might trying to destroy the two billion Chinese
people H going starve them to death they're
going to flood them out cause weather starve them to death there won't be any food they can't grow any
Gardens heck their P their pigs and their cows swam for High
Ground you know China's underwater right now it's
ridiculous and then even land that looks like it dried out did you see the mud
slide yesterday oh man hundreds and hundreds
of homes this mudslide must have been been a half a mile across and four
miles long hundreds and hundreds of homes and it was like it looked like this in in in the center of it and
around the homes looked just like this and it's like all of a sudden the ground just liquefied and it just
moved could that be an opportunity for some of these people to J
out to where see one thing about China's borders is is pretty hard to leave you
got to apply a long time in advance to leave I was in China at a dairy farm I was selling hydroponic equipment with
with helping this engineering firm get started and uh went to this guy who's considered a
fairly wealthy Dairy Farmer right he own a lot of land he owns a lots of cows he's rich in
China and he introduced me to his daughter who is about to graduate from
high school he says can you do me a favor Now understand I'd met the guy
about one hour before and I'm from a different foreign
land and he introduces me to his daughter wanted you to marry her no no
he wants her to go to school to one of the best colleges in California
right and he says can you do me a favor and I said what's that he tells his
daughter something that I can't understand she goes in the house she comes back out she brings out this
suitcase sets it down he opens it up he says you think
half million American would be enough to get my daughter house get her set up at the school would you help her do that I
can't leave the country I have to dairy farm I can't take her to
California she got Visa applied for it seven years ago she had to apply for it
seven years in advance to come to an American school and he wants to hand me a
suitcase with a half a million American dollars that he has to go to the airport with Chinese dollars and exchange it for
American dollars at the exchange rate to save thinking he can send that with her
so she can go to California buy a house and four years of college with a half million dollars she ain't going to get a
house in LA and go to a college in La for a half a million
dollars he's asking a perfect stranger to do that for
him to hand me a half a million dollars go ahead of time he knows I'm flying
home next week buy her a house and get her set up
in college so once she get there that's how loving and trusting
these people are
to me being from America half a million dollars in a
suitcase I can't even imagine giving that to one of my best friends and trusting him to
go buy me a house put me in college right much less a guy I met from another
country an hour ago I was born at night but it wasn't last night okay the right to to equality
in the eyes of the law and to equal representation the right to trial by jury being an impartial panel of one's
peers what did I tell you the legal definition of the word peers was is
someone from your own neighborhood who knows you who knows your situation in
life what if he knows that you can't hardly keep your wh on you can't hardly
keep your children fed and you went to the store and you stole dinner for your
kids because you had no money before your next paycheck he knew you were an honest man but that you had to do
something to feed your family I think the jury would be fairly lenient in that case don't you if they were a jury your
peers but what does our court system want us to do they want to find a a jury
from the next County who has no idea who you are doesn't know your character is in
doesn't know anything about you how can they judge a man if they don't know who you
are okay said ask not a trial by jury a trial by jury
not a jury trial yes the courts will try and force you if if you want a jury they'll force you to have a jury trial a
jury trial the judge knows that he can override the
jury if he doesn't like the outcome the right to appeal in law against
conviction or sentence are both the right to expose knowledge necessary to one's rights and freedoms see I'm
exercising that right right now I have the right to expose knowledge necessary
regarding one's rights and freedoms the right to Peaceful
Association assembly expression and protest the right to practice a religion and to have beliefs of one's choosing
the right to love and to consensually marriage with children as a
family the right to security from abuse persecution tyranny and War the right to
refuse to kill under command by the reason of
conscience the right to live in peace and be left alone when your law abiding you have the right to be left
alone to live in the pursuit of happiness
okay I second the last one hurt a little bit to read that
but a lot of times when you serve this country you're forced to do something that you shouldn't do and very few
people recognize one they shouldn't and I've watched orders be given to do something the was not
approved to do and I've watched people follow those
orders and it hurts when you see people you love that you fight beside fall in
unjust order rather than take that commanding off officer up on
trial see I spent two years in Washington DC at Jag trying my
commanding officer because he was trying to get us to do things that we weren't ordered to
do uh this is why I keep saying war is stupid because both countries are doing the exact same thing
defending their country and taking orders it's stupid it doesn't make any
sense well we used to go to war for a reason yeah not anymore such as Hitler
committing genocide when people commit genocide we should go to war we should stop that at all costs right now we
should be taking out that one million Chinese government for the genocide on their
people okay and we should be sinking Bill
Gates's Yacht for the genocide he's committed in Africa and India and
now and now he's about to do it on us
if we don't stop it so tell me is the government going to
take out Bill Gates soon I hope and pray they do because if
they don't somebody better stand up okay the N the number one right we
have our foundational Cornerstone right is our right of
self-determination never forget that I want to talk about the international
Covenant on civil and political rights for a minute yes I know it's a United Nations document do you know it was
written by a private person it was taken to the ha to try and create rights
worldwide with every country that's what his reasoning
was and it took 10 years to get it in front of the heg to be presented before
they adopted it then they gave every country that's a me a United Nations
country they gave them a 10-year period to sign on to
it that 10-year
period was was
1976 the United States refused to sign that until until Russia signed it Russia
signed it in 1992 Russia signed the international
cant on civil and political rights in 1992 and then they went home and they
rewrote the Russian Constitution and one of the first things
they did is elected President Putin and he is absolutely loved by his
people and they recognize through their constitution a man and a woman and a
person and the choice at any given time to be what you're supposed to be in that
jurisdiction they recognize that they recognize the right to a
family and the right to your children and since 1992 Russia has been
a Freer country than the United States of America Amica the propaganda you hear
about it here is false they come over here and they buy our aircraft manufacturing Bend Oregon is known for
its air small aircraft manufacturing we had Cessna plants there Lance air plants
King air plants there Epic Air manufacturing plants there there's
plants that make just specific aircraft equipment there's another plant that
makes an amphibious airplane I can't even think of the name of it there's all kinds of aircraft manufacturing in that
area you mean like goes under water no no it's an
amphibious it can it lands on water takes off on water it can take off on land or
water so any anyway hey that was good I saw the fear
in your eyes so anyway way um they come over and
they buy our aircraft manufacturing plants and invest in our aircraft manufacturing
plants they do all kinds of things when you go to Russia to show that they're Freer than we are here and what do we
call them bunch of Communists well that's what they were prior to 1992 how
long do we got to keep blaming them for that I mean seriously do you know I
honestly believe that within two months of President Trump taking office we would have had a trade deal
with Russia and when he would have been good friends with Putin and it all would have been fine except the government stepped the Democrats stepped in and
stopped it by blaming Russia for helping him win the election and blaming Russia
for this and blaming Russia for that I can honestly call a on
all that is that why mil got arrested because that was the focus of her
investigation I knew the second I watched that video that she was in trouble and she should be protected not
at home with her kids that's going to be a tough
fight it is exactly or Snowden or I mean
my my mentor taught me years ago he self taught himself his own like
youal super smart online Wade Nelson he explained to me
like this I I kept coming to him with these distra parents whose kids just got taken and fely accus he said if I commit
a crime a documented crime against my child arrest me and charge me
accordingly but to just arbitrarily snatch a child on an unfounded Anonymous
report by a possible vindictive ex spouse or angry neighbor or whoever and
physically remove that and I don't know why and I don't know
who and this is what he taught me how to he was teaching me how to help parents
on that pH of well that's that's why I'm trying to tell you they do it under the two doctrines of parents Patra and local
Paris that's how they do it they do it because we're citizens persons and residents we don't know our status they
do it because the state can claim to be the parent under a false and fraudulent doctrine that we let them get away with
because we we don't know it's a false and fraudu Doctrine we don't even we probably let me ask you how many have
ever heard the words unless you listen to my videos how many have ever heard the
words parents patre before to you know I mean on your own without listening to my videos very few
people aspa and title 4 the two acts of Congress that even set up
our child protective services agencies in the United States say in both acts which clearly states
their the intent of Congress right if if they say it so
plainly they cannot take a child from a parent without the parents
consent unless the parent through proper due process of law has been tried and
found guilty of a felony and then and only then they must search for a relative to place a child
with well that person is paying for their sin when he's out he served his time he
paid his debt to society he needs to get his kid back from that parent from that
relative and only if a relative doesn't step up to the plate can they place it
in a foster home temp temporarily if you go to jail for five
years on the sixth year if your kid's still underage you ought to get your kid back the day you walk out of prison and
the first thing they did in every case we worked on was they found the reason to disqualify every single
family it's exactly what they try and do 90% out of time not only what I'm seeing
I'm seeing it's even worse let's just say you got two parents husband and wife right I'm going to point at you but I
don't anyway let's just say she's a drug dealer or druggie she's
on meth and he's a good dad they'll take him away from the good dad give it to
her even though she's the one that signed the birth certificate as
an informant giving up the child in the first place now let's switch roles he's
a wife beater he yells at his kids he screams at them the neighbors see it
they call into DHS St has come takes the kids from the family they put her through hell for 18
to 24 months terminate her pral rights and give them back to him the abusive
parent they take him away from the good parent first and give him back to the bad parent I'm seeing that all over this
country you know why they do that why because then it's once you got away from the tough parent the good parent it's
easy to take it away from him you screw up one little bit and I'm going to just
rip them out out of your hands and it's going to be easy because we've got all this evidence that you were the bad parent or vice versa doesn't
matter 10 years ago what I was seeing as a I was dealing almost strictly with
women because the woman signed the birth certificate application as informant
they were taken away from the women and given them to the heirs the hierarchy the estate of the father
and I'm I was dealing all with women now I'm dealing with men just about as much as I'm dealing with women it's whoever's
the the better of the two parents is the one I'm working with
because that's the one they're taking them away from the better of the two div and
Conquer and that's what I'm seeing now that happen me that to me but it was
during my divorce and CPS wasn't involved the judge made the decision for
that well understand something hun on my
trafficking flowchart you know how many judges Guardian items and attorneys are
on that list trafficking children enough to make you
scream I mean they're trafficking children through our family courts let me ask you
this what gave a family court any Authority oh hold on what gave a family
court any Authority the mother knowing no yeah okay in a way your consent of
course gives them Authority but beside that what gave them any perceived
Authority the state Secretary of State licensed their business
it's a private business a private for-profit business licensed as a family
court not even really part of the judicial system they kind of are they
have to follow certain judicial guidelines like a doctor has to follow
the ama's guidelines but they're a private
for-profit business owned by somebody just like you would a McDonald's franchise if you own a McDonald's
franchise you got to serve a burger a certain way with a certain wrapper with a certain amount of lettuce and tomato
and cheese on it it's made from Hors meat or whatever I don't eat fast
food but what I'm saying is the family Court's doing the same
thing they're no different than
McDonald's n one of the Nazi CPS workers was Notorious and
out to one of the neighbors the road she got $4,000 for child
she they get bonuses and they get bonuses if they get
so many children she might get 4,000 per child and then she might get another $4,000 bonus if she got 10 in a month I
had two people in town telling me she wasn cocaine addi at well should be
happening is when they do that and you've got it on tape somebody I'd be showing up their house at 2:
a.m. let's just take that problem out right now see I'm getting kind of fed up I've
been doing this a long time and the longer I do it the worse it seems to get it's not like I'm I'm everything's
getting better I'm watching it get worse our nation's been going downhill now I'm
starting to see some light some hope barely at the end here I think it saved
my life I really do because you don't know how much I
wanted to arm up go hunting because there's so many of these
cases on video I've got an attorney out of the state of
Florida on video bragging to her co-workers as she s picks out
Children files false reports with CPS becomes the attorney in the case and
sells the child for 40,000 after she's made them jump
through 18 months of Hoops and terminat her peral rights
[Music] and okay all of that is SMU that's all
policy written by who I want to know who it was written by because it's just like that what we found on the
FDA they write 1398 policies that become law and that
one person who wrote them didn't have any authority to write them in the first
place and people were going to jail over it I've got four people in jail right now over that okay one more question and
then what's the code that you were referring to that say they do not have permission to take your child it's not a
code it is an act of Congress it's the American Safe family act and title four
D and E of the Social Security
Act title four d and e this is these are the acts that
Congress has set up the agency and this is how they're supposed to get paid okay
thank you guys very very much for sitting in the heat for three solid days
on steel chairs I'm proud of
you put thank you because uh this is how I
tell is by how many people stay to the end if I'm given the right information
so really appreciate you being here I love you all very
much you guys know app
