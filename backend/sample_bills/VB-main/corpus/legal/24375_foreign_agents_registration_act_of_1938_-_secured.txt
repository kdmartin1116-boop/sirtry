propaganda’ includes any oral, visual, graphic, written, 

pictorial, or other communication or expression by any 
person (1) which is reasonably adapted to, or which the 
person  disseminating  the  same  believes  will,  or  which 
he  intends  to,  prevail  upon,  indoctrinate,  convert,  in-
duce,  or  in  any  other  way  influence  a  recipient  or  any 
section of the public within the United States with ref-
erence  to  the  political  or  public  interests,  policies,  or

ican  republic  by  any  means  involving  the  use  of  force

merce or offering or causing to be offered in the United

activity  that  the  person  engaging  in  believes  will,  or

‘‘the  dissemination  of  political  propaganda  and  any 
other  activity  which  the  person  engaging  therein  be-
lieves will, or which he intends to, prevail upon, indoc-
trinate, convert, induce, persuade, or in any other way

fide  commercial,  industrial  or  financial  interests  of  a 
domestic person engaged in substantial commercial, in-
dustrial  or  financial  operations  in  the  United  States 
shall  not  be  deemed  to  serve  predominantly  a  foreign 
interest  because  such  activities  also  benefit  the  inter-
ests  of  a  foreign  person  engaged  in  bona  fide  trade  or 
commerce  which  is  owned  or  controlled  by,  or  which 
owns or controls, such domestic person: Provided, That 
(i)  such  foreign  person  is  not,  and  such  activities  are 
not  directly  or  indirectly  supervised,  directed,  con-
trolled,  financed  or  subsidized  in  whole  or  in  substan-
tial part by, a government of a foreign country or a for-
eign  political  party,  (ii)  the  identity  of  such  foreign 
person  is  disclosed  to  the  agency  or  official  of  the 
United  States  with  whom  such  activities  are  con-
ducted,  and  (iii)  whenever  such  foreign  person  owns  or 
controls such domestic person, such activities are sub-
stantially  in  furtherance  of  the  bona  fide  commercial, 
industrial  or  financial  interests  of  such  domestic  per-
son.’’

the  United  States  Postal  Service  information  in  com-

553), as amended’’.

tion  of  individuals’’  and  struck  out  from  definition  of

under the control of, a foreign principal, by requiring a 
showing not only of foreign connections but also of cer-
tain activities performed by the agent for foreign inter-
ests, by making change as it relates to problem of indi-
rect  control  exerted  by  foreign  principals  over  their 
agents,  by  including  political  activities  and  actions  as 
political  consultant,  by  excluding  attorneys  from  the 
relationship, by incorporating provisions of former par. 
(3) in par. (2) where a person assumes or purports to act

ficials contained in former par. (4).

§ 612. Registration statement 

(a) Filing; contents 

No  person  shall  act  as  an  agent  of  a  foreign

this  section,  the  registrant  shall  give  notice  to 
the  Attorney  General  of  any  changes  therein 
within ten days after such changes occur. If the 
Attorney General, having due regard for the na-
tional  security  and  the  public  interest,  deter-
mines that it is necessary to carry out the pur-

lar case, require supplements to the registration

(d)  Filing  of  statement  not  deemed  full  compli-
ance nor as preclusion from prosecution 

The fact that a registration statement or sup-
plement  thereto  has  been  filed  shall  not  nec-
essarily  be  deemed  a  full  compliance  with  this 
subchapter  and  the  regulations  thereunder  on 
the  part  of  the  registrant;  nor  shall  it  indicate 
that  the  Attorney  General  has  in  any  way 
passed  upon  the  merits  of  such  registration 
statement  or  supplement  thereto;  nor  shall  it 
preclude prosecution, as provided for in this sub-
chapter,  for  willful  failure  to  file  a  registration 
statement  or  supplement  thereto  when  due  or 
for  a  willful  false  statement  of  a  material  fact 
therein or the willful omission of a material fact 
required to be stated therein or the willful omis-
sion of a material fact or copy of a material doc-
ument  necessary  to  make  the  statements  made 
in  a  registration  statement  and  supplements

eliminate  inappropriate  duplication,  may  per-

viously filed by such agent of a foreign principal 
under the provisions of said section.

ment  of  furnishing  any  of  the  information  re-
quired  by  this  section,  of  any  person  who  is 
listed  as  a  partner,  officer,  director,  or  em-
ployee  in  the  registration  statement  filed  by 
an agent of a foreign principal under this sub-
chapter, and 

(2) from the requirement of furnishing any of 
the  information  required  by  this  section  of 
any agent of a foreign principal. 

where  by  reason  of  the  nature  of  the  functions 
or  activities  of  such  person  the  Attorney  Gen-
eral, having due regard for the national security 
and  the  public  interest,  determines  that  such 
registration,  or  the  furnishing  of  such  informa-
tion,  as  the  case  may  be,  is  not  necessary  to 
carry out the purposes of this subchapter. 
(g)  Electronic  filing  of  registration  statements
