Notwithstanding that some people, in obedience to utilitarian
principles,

years sought to decry the classical languages as a
training for the youthful mind,

language is beginning to be cultivated even by those teachers who

conduct national schools, more or less in amount, according a:
they are anxious to place their schools in a position to entitle

them to look

for

some of the rewards proposed by Government

for successful teaching.

This

is

as

for

professional avocations,

him in

respect of every other advantage and endowment, has not had

the opportunity of such training.

To facilitate a study so useful is the purpose of the following

work.

according to the capacity of the learner to understand and follow,

which should exhibit themselves in the pages of a book designed
for the use of a beginner, and especially for that class of beginners

who labour without the assistance of a viva voce teacher.

The

distinctive plan of the following Treatise has been conceived with

a view to obviate this want; and the conviction in the

of a few of the great leading

principles of Latin construction, by examples judiciously selected

method which an

ele-

execution of the plan.

The

authors, and the rules

and observations thereon are so system-

atized, that a learner never meets with a principle of construction
in one sentence,

which has not been laid down and explained

some foregoing one.

It

is

and principles are seen to result from each other

in the construc-

tion of a language, as propositions in geometry ; but it is asserted
that there exists no reason

why, in a work intended

student of a language out of difficulties, there should be presented

The writer of this little work has as little faith as any one in the
utility and success of works professedly designed to make knowledge easy,

and desires earnestly to impress on the minds of

those who may address themselves for assistance to the following
pages, that no aid can obviate the necessity of deep and anxious
study, and no book, however judiciously written, can supply the

place of painstaking and laborious assiduity on their part.

LATIN GRAMMAR.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
1. All the words cf the Latin language are subdivided, for the
sake of convenience, into eight heads, called classes of words, or
parts of speech.
noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, pre2. These are*

—

position, conjunction, interjection.
3.

Of these the four first admit of inflexion

some instances, admits of comparison

;

the adverb, in

and the three last named

;

are not modified in any form whatever.
4.

The inflexion of a word is the change, generally of termina-

tion, it

undergoes in order to the expression of a difference of

idea.
5.

This change, when the noun, pronoun, or adjective

ferred to, is usually called declension ;

is

re-

when the verb, conjugation.

On the Noun, i.e. the name for any being or thing which may serve
as the subject of discourse.
6.

To nouns belong gender, number, person, and case.

7.

The genders of nouns are three — masculine, feminine, and

neuter.
8.

Some nouns, the names of animals, which maybe masculine

or feminine, are called common, as parens, a parent.

—

The doubtful gender has no existence in reality, and
Note.
only means that a particular word is treated by one writer as
masculine, by another as feminine.
9. The number of nouns is twofold, singular and plural ; the
former is used when one object is denoted, the latter when two or
more.
10. The persons of nouns ar.? three
first, second, and third.
A njun standing for the speaker is said to be of the first, and for the-

—

person spoken to, of the second person ; all other nouns, however
used, are said to belong to the third person.
11. The case of a noun, pronoun, or adjective is the form it
takes in its declension.
12. There are six cases in the Latin language
genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, and ablative.

— nominative,

The participle is sometimes regarded as a distinct class

13. The nouns of the Latin language, as regards their declension, are subdivided into five classes, distinguished by the termination of their genitive singular.

cases in the plural number end in a; in their other cases they

appended here, because nouns of the neuter gender, with but few
exceptions, belong to the second or third declension.

Note 3. When the nominative singular of a noun of the third
declension ends in e, if it be of the neuter gender, the ablative
will end in i ; and the nominative plural of such will be formed
by adding a to the ablative the genitive plural also will end in
ium: thus, nominative, hastile ; ablative, hastili ; nominative
;

plural, hastilia ; genitive, hastilium.

Notes on the five Declensions,

The nominative and vocative singular of a noun, with few

which obtain mostly in the second declension (see
Notes 1 and 2, Second Declension), are alike, so are also the
nominative and vocative plural.
2. The dative and ablative singular of the second declension
are alike, so also are the dative and ablative plural of all declenexceptions,

Proper names have no plural, except such as want the

b.

When a noun has no singular, its declension may be ascer-

tained by its genitive plural.
c.

Consult note a.

Note also, some nouns are not declined that is, have the
same form in whatever case they may be used. Such nouns are
;

mostly, if not always, used as nominatives and accusatives, as

ON THE ADJECTIVE,

ON THE ADJECTIVE.
The adjective expresses the state or quality of the noun.
The English adjective is not inflected the Latin adjective is
;

inflected in gender,

number, and case.

The Latin adjective is declined according to the declension of
nouns.

The

adjective in Latin

is

declined with three, two,

and one

termination.

An adjective whose nominative case singular has three terminations, is declined like the first and second declension of nouns ;

the adjective in the feminine form is declined like the first, in the

masculine and neuter form like the second declension.
An adjective whose nominative has two terminations or one, is
inflected like the third declension of nouns.
When an adjective in any of its cases has three terminations,
the first is masculine, the second feminine, and the third neuter
when it has two terminations, the first is masculine and feminine,
and the second neuter; and when it has only one termination, it
is of all genders.

In their other cases they follow the

declension of bonus.

COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.

—

Adjectives have three degrees of comparison
the positive, the
comparative, and the superlative.
The positive is the adjective in its simple state, as tristis.
The comparative is formed from the first case of the positive
which ends in i, by adding thereto or to make the masculine and
feminine, and us for the neuter
thus, dative, tristi ; comparative,
:

tristior, tristius.

Note 1. The

first

case of an adjective of one or

nations which ends in

i

is

two termi-

the dative, of an adjective of three

The superlative is formed by adding
ssimus to the same part
as, tristi, tristissimus.
Note 2. The superlative degree is declined like bonus. The
following is a model of the declension of the comparative
terminations is the genitive.

Note 3. If a vowel precede us in the positive, the degrees are
formed usually by prefixing the adverb magis for the comparative,
and maxime for the superlative
as, pius, magis pius, maxime
:

pius.

Note 4. If the positive end in er, the superlative is formed by
adding thereto rimus : as, teter ; superlative, teterrimus.
The following adjectives have a peculiar formation in the

A pronoun (pro, for, nomen, a name) is a word used instead of
a noun.

Pronouns admit of person, gender, number, and case.

They

are usually classified into personal, possessive, demonstrative,
;
and, unlike the noun and the adjective, are not
reducible as to their inflexion to any heads or classes.

Formation of the several parts {not radical) of Active Verbs.

From
cative,

the perfect indicative are

amaveram ;

perfect,

formed the pluperfect indiand future potential,

pluperfect,

amaverim, amavissem, amavero ; and perfect infinitive, amavisse.
From the present indicative are formed the imperfect and
future indicative, amabam, amabo ; the imperative mood
present and imperfect potential, amem, amarem ; present infinitive,
amare ; and present participle, amans.
From the first supine in urn are formed the second supine,
amatu ; future participle (in rus), amaturus ; and perfect or past
participle, amatus.
Note.
The mode of transition from the radical to the derived
part in each conjugation may be easily seen by inspection.
The Latin esse serves the same purpose as the English verb
to be, by uniting with the past participle to form several tenses
of the passive voice
its inflection,
therefore, is necessarily
learned before that of the passive verb.

Instructions.

Tf it were required to give the Latin for they will condemn,

1.

the first thing to be determined is the mood and tense, the voice,

number, and person of the English verb. In the present instance,
it is the future tense, indicative mood, third person plural, and
the active voice.
Next, damno is the first conjugation, and must
be treated like amo, the future of which is amabo, and is found

by changing the o'of the present into abo : thus, the future of
damno is damnabo, the third plural of which, according to the
model of the inflexion of the persons of this tense in the first
conjugation, is damnabunt, which, as the nominative of the pronoun is not expressed in Latin, except for emphasis' sake, is the
literal

representative of the English expression, they will con-

demn.

Here is the passive voice, potential

THE ADVERB.
The adverb modifies the force of the word with which it is
connected in Latin, as in English
as, magnopere cupio discere,
I am very anxious to learn
wherein magnopere modifies the
signification of the word cupio.
Note.
Some adverbs in Latin admit of comparison thus,
bene, well
comparative, melius, better
optime, best.
The
comparative of the adverb, in such cases, is the comparative
neuter of the adjective agreeing with a noun understood, which is
governed by some preposition also understood.

THE PREPOSITION, CONJUNCTION, AND INTERJECTION.

THE PREPOSITION.
The preposition connects words as, exivit ex urbe, he dewherein ex is the preposition, and connects
parted from the city
Me, the subject of exivit, or exivit itself, with urbe.
Prepositions require after them a noun, or its representative,
the pronoun.
Such noun or pronoun, except the preposition be in composition, that is, form a part of another word, will always be
in either the accusative or ablative case.
Some prepositions govern the accusative, and others the ablative case, and some govern both cases but a preposition governing
different cases varies its signification according to the case it
governs.
The following are the principal prepositions which govern the
:

;

;

ablative case

:

—A,

ab, abs, absque, coram, clam, cum, de, e, ex,

prae, pro, sine, tenus.

The following are the principal prepositions which govern the
accusative :

— Ad, adversus* adversum,

circiter, cis, citra,

ante, apud, circa, circum,

contra, erga, extra, infra, inter,

intra,

juxta,

penes, per, pone, post, pragter, prope, propter, secundum, supra,
trans, ultra, usque, versus.
In, sub, subter, and super are the principal prepositions which,
varying their significations, govern the accusative and ablative.

THE CONJUNCTION.
The

conjunction

is

a particle which unites words or clauses

when clauses, the preceding one

is modified by the
some particular of time, place, manner, &c. &c. as,
eram miser, cum amarem, I was wretched when I loved wherein the cum connects the latter with the former clause, the state

THE INTERJECTION.
Any word or particle which is used to express a sudden feeling of passion or emotion is called by the name interjection
thus, ah ! oh !
:

In the Latin, as in the English language, nouns, adjectives,
as, nefas ! mise-

and verbs are frequently used interjectionally
rablle ! &c. &c.

Definitions and Explanations of Terms used in the following
Treatise.
1.

Translation

is

the rendering of the words of one language

into words in another, so as thereby to express the same idea.
2. The construction of a language (generally) is the putting
together (literally piling or building up) its words agreeably to
the observed usage thereof.
The construction of a particular
word is the formula it requires to be used in connexion with it

dare librum magistro, to give a book to the master from
which it appears that the verb dare is constructed with an accusative of the thing given, and a dative of the person or thing
which receives it.

'as,

A

transitive verb (transeo, to pass over) is a verb that
3.
expresses an act which passes on to or affects an object thus,
wherein lunam is the object
condere lunam, to hide the moon
or the thing affected by the act of hiding.
The ear always
detects the transitive verb, which leaves a vacuum after it, the
'sense not being concluded until such vacuum is filled up.
4. The subject of a sentence is the word which is the subject
of conversation, that is, the word of which the verb makes the
This subject is in the nominative case thus the
affirmation.
subject of a verb and its nominative case are identical.
5. The agent is the word which expresses the performer of an
In an active verb the subject or nominative case and the
act.
agent are identical: thus, "I sleep;" where / is the subject or
nominative of the verb sleep, and also the agent or performer
In the passive verb, on the contrary, the
of the act of sleeping.
agent and subject are not identical: as, "The house is burned
by fire ;" where house is the subject, and^re the agent.
6. The complement of a word (compleo, to fill up) is the word
or formula of words connected with or appended to it for the
purpose of explanation thus, " The Queen of England, Engwherein of England in the former, and England's
land's Queen
in the latter expression, is the complement of Queen.
deponent verb (deponere, to lay down) is a verb which,
7.
though passive in inflexion, lays down, that is, gives up, the
passive signification, and is active in sense.
simple sentence has in it but one subject and one verb.
8.
Attention is directed in this definition to the force of and, because a sentence having one subject and two verbs, or two subjects and one verb, is not simple, being resolvable into as many
simple sentences as there are either subjects or verbs.

A complex sentence is one which may be resolved into two or
more simple sentences.
9. A word is said to be syncopated when a letter or syllable
A

The mark ( ) is generally set
is elided from the middle thereof.
as, quierant, for quieveover the part where the want exists
:

rant.
10. The context of a word or passage is the sentence or
sentences which stand connected with it.
The context is frequently the best commentary as to the meaning of a doubtful
word or passage.
11. The influence which one word exercises over another is
properly called government, inasmuch as the governed word
assumes a definite form, in obedience, as it were, to the word
by which such influence is exerted thus, in the expression
Britannice Regina, the former word explaining the latter is said
to be governed by it in the genitive case, according to the prin:

ciple laid down in Rule 5.
12.

Words are said to be disjunctively connected when they

are united in the same link by a copula, which

shows

that the

thing asserted is said of one to the exclusion of the other

copuiatively

connected

when the

assertion

and

equally

of all.
13. The antecedent is the word for which the relative stands,
and is sometimes called the correlative.
14. A periphrasis is a form of expression whereby an idea
is represented by many words which could be expressed directly
by few thus, " From the rismg to the setting of the sun," i. e.
from east to west.
15. Attraction is a species of construction which exhibits itself
in various forms, the principal of which is that wherein the rela:

tive is put in (attracted to) the case of the antecedent, irrespec-

tively of the position of the relative in its own clause.

16. Hendiadis is a figure of speech whereby what is really
but one is represented as two things
thus, gemmis auroque,
with gems and gold, i. e. with golden gems.
17. Synecdoche is a figure of speech whereby a part is put for
the whole.

3.

Transitive verbs govern an accusative case.

Some prepositions require the noun after them to be in the

accusative, and some in the ablative case.

One noun governs another which explains or modifies it in

6. The word which expresses the instrument with which, the
cause for which, or the manner in which an act is performed, is
put in the ablative case.
Note.
The first rule means that the subject and the verb
must be in the same number and person; the second that the
adjective and the noun must be in the same gender, number, and
case
and the third rule states a general principle to which there
(are many exceptions, which will be considered hereafter.

look out for

all

the words thereof in the index or dictionary.

something.
The next thing is to find out that something. The
only noun in the sentence which can express the something
routed is copias, because it is the only one in the accusative case,
and by Rule 3 transitive verbs govern the accusative.
The sentence thus far is in English, " Scipio routed (the) forces ;" and
the remaining word, Annibalis, being in the genitive case, belongs
to copias in construction, and so in translation, by Rule 5 ; and
the whole sentence, therefore, when rendered into English, is,
" Scipio routed the forces of Annibal."
In addition to this, the
particulars of the declension of each word inflected are to be
ascertained

Observations on the foregoing Rules.

Rule 1.
1.

Plurality of idea in the subject constitutes the necessity of

the plural construction of the verb.

The subject is plural when it

consists of one or more plural nouns, or two or more singular nouns

copulatively connected

;

it

is

also plural

when it consists of a

noun in the singular conveying plurality of idea, (generally called
a noun of multitude,) or of a single noun associated with a
formula of words, of some of which, though not in the nominative
case, the verb affirms.
2. The infinitive mood, or part, or the whole of a sentence,
supplies the place of a nominative.
3.

Two singular nouns disjunctively connected have a verb

When two nouns, one singular, the other plural,
are disjunctively connected, it is manifest that, though the verb
affirms of both, it can agree in number only with one
this one
singular.

any violation of philosophical grammar.

with the first rather than the second, and with the second rather
than with the third.

Rule 2.
If there be several nouns of different genders qualified by
one adjective, it cannot agree in gender with them all. It is made
5.

in such case to agree with the masculine rather than the feminine,

and with the feminine rather than the neuter.

Rule 3.

To this the construction of many verbs exhibits an excep-

6.

tion
misereor and miseresco govern the genitive, potior and utor
govern the genitive or ablative. Verbs expressing profit or hurt
to any one (except Icedo, juvo, adjuvo, offendo, and delecto), verbs
of commanding and obeying, or resistance, verbs of trusting, those
which express threats and anger, and many verbs compounded
:

with ad, con, sub, ante, post, ob, in, inter, prce, super, satis, bene,

and male, govern the dative case.

Rule 4.
7.

The preposition

tenus,

if the

noun

after

it

be plural,

is

usually followed by a genitive case.

Rule 5.
8.

The genitive complement must express something different

from that which governs it.
9. This genitive is frequently changed into the dative.
10. Nouns which are names for the same thing are put in the
same case this is usually called apposition by grammarians.
11. Should the latter of two nouns (one being the complement
of the other) have an adjective of praise or dispraise, or, in fact,
any qualification joined with it, such noun is more usually ex:

pressed in the ablative than the genitive.
12. Opus and usus, when they signify need, are followed by the
ablative.
