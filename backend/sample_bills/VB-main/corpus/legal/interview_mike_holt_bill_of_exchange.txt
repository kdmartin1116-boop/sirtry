hello and welcome back to the channel and thank you for joining me in another of my wonderful interviews now you may remember about a year or so ago it must
have been I had a very lovely gentleman from Australia come on the show and he told me a
fascinating piece of uh well not I was going to say history but it's not history law law the bills of exchange he
introduced me to the bills of exchange and how it was possible to pay utility bills using that trust fund that we have
all been given and not told about and some of us have worked out what's going on and as you may remember I did attempt
to do this and on one attempt it worked and a a bill I had was settled I made a
video about it called it bloody works and the second time I tried it they are
now pushing back it's with great pleasure to bring that gentleman back to not only talk about that but also find
out some more of the common law stuff that he's been doing and some of the personal stuff that's been happening to
him as a result of pushing Back Against The Tyranny his name is Mike Holt and he
joins me now from Australia hello Mike good day mate how are you yes I'm very
well it's lovely to have you back um it's looking summer it's looking summery
where you are we over here in the UK uh heading fast into a wet drizzly winter
probably manufactured by um those people spraying the skies but um it's lovely to
have you back on the show yes it's lovely to be here Richard and thank you and I am absolutely impressed
with the work you've been doing I have been since that interview I have been inundated with um emails from people
around the world uh just today I had an email from Slovenia Ireland Portugal UK Canada
America in one day all asking for help about the bo is yeah well it keep the
yeah the bills of exchange it's keeping you very busy I'm sorry about that oh my pleasure and I I'm happy to help anybody
who wants to learn how to do this because when you think about it these people have been stealing our money out
of the trust and from us they've been making us pay these illegal fines so
when we start withholding our cash our hard-earned cash and we then use our
trust money and they have to figure out what to do with that we're not only costing them a lot of time and we're
costing them money and this is how we under undermine and beat the wef well that's a noble noble thing to
do uh see as they have been keeping us under the thumb for a long time um so so
may I say first of all thank you very much for your previous one because that um has helped a lot of people as well as
myself personally um even though we're now seeing a little bit of push back um but only the other day a lady emailed me
to say that she had a utility company a well-known company in the UK and she did
exactly as You' demonstrated on the show before um and what I had made a video on
where I had had some success and uh at first they were a bit reluctant she
phoned them up had a conversation with them sorted it out and confirmed two payments of a utility company out of her
trust fund and not her personal funds and she's thrilled so um okay but here's
few pieces of advice for people first of all never speak to them you only deal
with them in writing so if they write if they call you or email you you ignore it and you say I'm sorry I will only deal
with you in writing put it in writing and I'll get back to you um yes secondly
a lot of people give up halfway through because they think it's too hard and what do I do now well we're here to tell
them that but the fact is you've got to stay strong if you're going to win this
you've got to stay strong never give in yeah no I I totally agree and and the writing thing is exactly what I've been
doing my phone is permanently on silent so I do get these letters um one from
the water company that was saying we've been trying to ring you to discuss this and and I just wrote back to them and
said all correspondence will be done in writing I mean they don't like it but
that's how they're going to communicate with this legal fiction no and look I've been having fantastic um success since I
spoke to you that was back in January was it yeah I mean it was either this
year or last year I mean it seems a long time ago was about January I think well I haven't paid a water an electricity
bill since then I've paid off a $14,000 Bill to the Department of Veterans
Affairs I've paid off numerous well not numerous a few fines uh I'm just paying off everything
and right now I'm helping my brother pay for a car accident that he had um a a an
insurance company's going after him so today I got him to sign the bill and I'll I'll send that off um and I'm going
to do my my wife's car pay that off and I'm going to do her uh credit card now
there is a little bit of a a caveat there um be very careful who you use
with this with only do it with banks or companies that are backed by Banks like
insurance companies or government don't do it to private companies because you're depriving they don't have access
to your set of KV trust right now i' I'd like to share the screen here if I may
you might have to uh turn on I might have to make um yes so okay I didn't know you could do that so I'm not quite
uh because I don't record in Zoom so but let me uh hang on a minute let me just work out how to do that click on sh yeah
multiple Advanced sharing options it's usually in security isn't it here we go share screen
screen okay all right so the first thing I want to show
you where the heck is it ah
yes I've lost the DAR thing hang on a moment that's all right yeah there we
go okay I've made some changes to the um
the the web page um so so here is where you can find your country's bills of
exchange now today I got about four countries send me their that'll be going in here and as you can see I've been
getting responses from quite a few countries um I've also added a
um a little see this um you see this blurb here I've created a um a word
document and you just download it print it out and stick it on instead so it
makes it easy you don't have to keep writing all this stuff and creating an awful looking mess right yeah oh that's
that's very interesting uh I've got more coming now let me go over here to the um homepage and I'll show you something
else that I've got I got hold of our Australian bills of exchange
act which is this one here we've got the bills of exchange act
1909 and I downloaded this directly off the government um
acts you know with depository so this is the this is the official bills of
exchange act 1909 and let's say all right here's up
here we've said section 22 what is section 22 say
definition so this is the bills of exchange act in Inland and foreign bills
an inland bill is a bill which is or on the face of it reports to be both drawn
and payable Within australasia or draws within so everything is here this is the
law they cannot argue with the law so when I start putting up all of these uh
links to the other um countries just go and click on the link and read the thing
um section 68 for instance is very important to read uh it's called
cancellation and when a when a bill is intentionally cancellated canceled by the holder or his her agent and the
cancellation is apparent thereon the bill is discharged so if they cancel the bill by sending it back to you it's paid
or if they ignore you and don't accept it that's paid two in like manner any party liable
on a bill may be discharged by the intentional cancellation of his or her signature by the holder of his or her
agent so in other words when you send it in if somebody there oh no we can't we cancel that signature in that case any
endorser who would have had a right of recourse against the party whose signature is canceled is also
discharged a cancellation made unintentionally or under a mistake or without the authority of the holder is
inoperative but where a bill or any signature thereon appears to have been cancelled the burden of pro proof lies
on the party who alleges that the cancellation was made unintentionally or under a mistake or without Authority in
other words they have to accept it and they we don't accept mistakes so this is
all very clear um we've also um had a lot of questions from especially uh
Americans and um Canadians they they seem to think that they're under a different law first of all Canada is the
same as the British and UK well the UK and Australia we're all part of the
Commonwealth so it's still basically the same law the wording may be slightly different but it's the law for
the um oh I've just forgotten oh yeah
ucc3 now let me just go and find that for you while I talk um
ucc3 are you on a moment that's all right I'm sure the audience are sitting
here with baited breath well I hope they're following along because this well that's what I mean I'm sure they
are and and of course they can go to the website and and check it out I'll leave a link in the description so that people
can have it side by side if necessary so this is on the law. cornell.edu so this
is where America puts their laws and as you can see here this is basically the
same can't can't actually see it you need to go back into the okay going there
now where' I put the UC there it is there so many windows open yeah so this
is the Cornell Law School and here it explains everything about um article 3
negotiable instruments and most countries in the west are under UCC law
right right so this tells them exactly what a a bill of exchange is and how to
use it any instrument really any Financial instrument and I I recommend
people do their research learn all this read all this stuff because the more you know the easier it becomes and as you
can see it's not that big of course you've got to read all of this stuff but the the general stuff there is very
simple to uh read and understand so we're finding out more and more every
day and uh is is that link on your um on the web page that you showed me before
it will be tomorrow yes right okay cool I I as you know I've been very ill in
the last week or so so today is actually the first say that I'm actually up on my feet and running around so well thank
you for giving us your time no I was looking forward to this my friends ah
excellent yeah well there more people that know you know this at the moment there's so many people being squashed
with poverty the cost of living and if we're able to help them you know it's an honorable thing and as you say they've
been taking the money they've taken and all these socalled uh Elites which we
tend to call parasites I mean they're using that trust fund themselves so they know how to do it that's right somebody
asked me today um if uh an insurance company can take the uh payment out of
the trust fund uh or no pay out of my trust fund for a claim and I said no
they take uh premiums so therefore they must use those premiums to pay out on claims they can't just go and get your
trust money right that's your now here the good news I'm working with a small
team here and we're now we've now figured out the access to the trust and
I'm I'm going to test it it's going to take me about three months to test but if I'm a successful and I believe I will
be um I'll be getting my money every month probably in a say a million or a
million and a half a month can you spend that amount good try I'm old enough that I've
got to try everything yeah absolutely what have you got to lose you know that's the thing uh that is I mean
that's incredible and and and I suppose some people will be looking at this and going with skeptical eyes going is that
really possible but then as you say you've got to try it test it and if the results are positive then um why not
yeah absolutely um you know we we have been under the thumb for so long that
we've now you know we're like in the the um what's that syndrome the Stockholm syndrome we're so afraid of the
government that we're not even you know we're not even going to do this sort of thing but stop being afraid they are the
public servants we are the Masters remember that yes we these people to
depart into government over us not the bureaucrats of course but the government approves all these things so if they
come back at you and start trying to Strongarm you no you are the servant you
do what I tell you and this is how you do it and this is why you do it so it's
very simp and and once you've got that mindset it's very empowering it is very
so I don't care anymore I don't even have a license I don't even have a registered car anymore I just go and you
know people say how can you do that well yeah ask yourself Richard uh a century ago your grandfather was probably riding
around on a horse wasn't he well he was he do need a license exactly did he did
he need to pay a road tax to go anywhere no not a private road so what's the
problem exactly I mean in the old days they were tolls to um put up to to get
the roads into some shape you didn't have to take them you could go on all the all the byways and other routes yeah
um down in Brisbane now we have a wonderful system of underground tunnels and big Bridges and all sorts of things
and you have to pay a toll not me I just drive in and drive out and uh when they
send me the bill I just send them back at Boe right yeah so that's it this year I
think I paid off about four fines so uh they just go
away that is incredible um o over here we if you say get a speeding fine on a
Motorway that's camera related um you get a notice of intended
prosecution it does sound like blackmail because they basically say tell us who the driver is so we can find that person
or we will prosecute you and um and and so there there's a slightly different
from a parking ticket where you immediately get the fine where you could just go okay yeah I can pay that with a
Boe well there is a problem with that in the law because by law you must be
observed by a human person committing a crime right the
camera what's the camera yeah well this is I mean just to give you a bit of a
story a friend of mine had a a speeding ticket that the Gantry changed and so they got this notice of intended
prosecution so um I helped them out now I mean I'm not an expert on this I'm the one asking the questions but over two
years of doing this I've absorbed and talking to people like yourself and what have you absorb a bit so I said look I'll help you write a letter because
they wanted to know who the driver was and I said well we'll you know we'll desperately try and help you to find out
who the driver is can you send us some evidence that um a this car was even there and they sent a lovely picture
from a camera and the Crux of it was I was basically saying well that's very nice but you do know the motion picture
industry has been manipulating pictures left right and Center for for dony years and also where are your Witnesses you
know camera isn't really a witness and it it did shut them up yeah I I can't
remember his name but there's a com comedian over there in the UK who got a ticket like that and it was just a
picture of his car and they had stuck on there um something like U no parking so
he sent it back and he said I am currently on the moon and he sent a
picture of his car with on the [Laughter]
moon and he got away with it got oh never mind too
hard I think this is the way to approach these people is using a little bit of fun and a bit of creativity and laughing
at them yeah now I want to show you something else and um this is a a draft letter that I'm
going to put up on the website too it's um this is what I've um responded to the
Brisbane City council with uh to their first um response which was to deny they
they actually wrote to me after I sent the Boe and they said um uh we've reviewed your um uh appeal and we're not
going to allow it you have to pay so I said hi Brisbane City Council and it's unknown author of the demand this is to
acknowledge that I've got your presentment this is an important word right and the amount sought has already
been settled and discharged with the bill of exchange I sent you I'm sure it is in the file you keep on my account
and you may wish to so give them the law right right yeah and then said you have
mistakenly claimed that I have applied for the infringement to be withdrawn I have not asked for it to be withdrawn in
fact I have already settled the account but it appears that you are unable to understand how to process my bill of
Exchange in that case I suggest you find someone of higher rank than yourself to process and settle the account and
that's it and you just keep on giving them all that stuff and and you give them the links and then as you have
already cons confirmed you have received the settlement perhaps you can invite me on the following no one has signed the
presentment I received by email or mail whatever it is so anything in in red you
change and put it to for your circumstance therefore I cannot determine who may be held accountable
and liable for issuing your presentment SL statement plan thank you for your
acknowledging my payment but I have not received a properly formatted receipt by La you are required to send a properly
for formatted receipt to my address above have you sent me as you have sent me a
presentment to pay for the amount already settled are you claiming the Australian Boe act 1909 is no longer in
force or valid and does not apply to your registered company ab and so and so so I'll put this up on the website
there's other stuff in here that's very useful as well and uh people can use this as a as a template don't use it
word for word no cherry pick what you need for your circumstances now a lot of
people have what do I write use that
yeah absolutely and and I think that's one of the things that a lot of people um are just struggling with because they
want the easy way they just want okay I don't want to do the work but if you do the work and you understand and i' you
know been working out my how I write my letters is different to how anybody else writes a letter and then so when they
receive it it's an individual letter it's not just oh yeah this was downloaded from the internet and then
they treat you differently cuz they assume then you don't know what you're talking about because it's just a template you've got from anywhere that's
right no um if you start dealing with them from a pos position of strength you
will win remember you're dealing with criminals and Bullies yes absolutely so
was that was that letter that you've just shown us was that in response to what we would have over here as a council tax no that was to a fine a
parking my my daughter drove my car into Brisbane and parked over a yellow line or something so they wanted
$325 or something yeah so I sent that back to them and yesterday I got a
letter back saying um uh we have received it and we we we I'm not going
to accept that um and this is considered to be council's final decision on this
matter I don't give a damn what you think I'm going to write back to you now and I'm going to give you such a a
kicking in the backside so yes but I'll do it very politely and I'll do it from
position of strength absolutely fir they don't dictate to us we tell them well
this is it absolutely they've assumed some authority over us and as you say they are public servants yeah and this
is the problem throughout the world all of these bureaucrats and governments now have assumed Authority that they do not
have so I'm just waiting now for Trump to get elected because things are going to change well let's hope so let's let's
hope so um in in the last time we spoke I know that there had been some um you
were dealing with some personal problems with all of this I mean I guess this is just part for the course really when you
are poking the uh The Hornet's Nest yeah we we call it the tall poppy syndrome oh
the tall poppy syndrome yeah you you're the tall poppy you get slopped down yeah
no um as you know I was five years ago I was summoned uh to court because I um
published a an article on my website about a court case going on in Victoria
now I live in Queensland about a th000 kilometers away and I didn't know there
was a suppression order on so I wrote the article and published it and as soon as I was told by the solicitor oh you
can't do that there's a suppression order I took it down and thought no more right a couple of months later I get the
police turn up at my house and steal all my computers my hard drives uh documents
my even my phone and then I get a summons to court now they drag this is just before Co So Co intervened and it
dragged on for five years up until this year so yeah so may I was forced to go
down there actually last year the end of last year uh I was arrested
by the um Australian federal police because I refused to go to Melbourne by law I did not have to go to Melbourne
and one day I walked out of my my house and intending to do some work on the car
and I was swooped on by about a dozen cops couple of them were AFP Australian federal police put in handcuffs shoved
into a jail and then taken down to Melbourne by plane and shoved into jail
for a total of six days that's going to cost them a lot of money because we calculated the the days involved comes
out to about $44 million wow by by law by law yeah it's
about a million .25 or something per day for being incarcerated illegally right
right so um anyway I thought the next time I was in I was summoned in May and
I thought oh I'm not going to go through that again so so I went down there and I went to court and I argued hard as I
could but the judge was just so biased and and corrupt they convicted me I was
before a jury right buty the jury believed what the judge told them and
the police so I'm not a lawyer so I wasn't very good at arguing however they
gave me a $4,000 fine and six days served I walked out for a free man I
never paid the fine if they had if they' sent me a bill for the fine guess what I'd do with
it of course why not yeah and then um a
couple of months ago I get a phone call from this guy he said I'm a lawyer and I've seen what's happened to you he said
I'm disgusted by the be the behavior of the Victorian courts you've been hard done by I'd like to represent you on a
no win no fee basis and he's been working on it ever since I spoke to him today and he said um I've got the
documents ready we'll be reviewing it over the weekend um you have a look at it and then we'll send it off it's said
okay I said go ahead go to court so uh yeah you know the universe is looking
for me they're looking after me that's that's that's a good that's a
good thing I mean are you concerned a bit that um I mean you know lawyers sort
of do take their Oaths to the uh private barain Guild and that's where they're supposed to be with their loyalty first
rather than any client even if it is no win no fee well you got to take your chances
haven't you yeah and you know since all this happened I've lost all fear I don't
care and at my age you know I'm 77 years old who cares I'll be gone soon anyway
well not too soon I know but you know life is short enjoy it get out there and
have fun never mind these these bullies yes and and I suppose that is I mean it's an interesting um attitude to have
as you say at 77 and I'm slowly creeping in that direction people in their 20s
and 30s who have their life ahead of course have more to lose I suppose especially if they've got young children
and and they've got certain responsibilities uh it's it's much more difficult for them to remove the fear
because of the people with the big sticks but when you remove that fear
here you all all of a sudden you start defending your rights and when you
defend your rights they have nothing to go after you with because you are detected under the law so don't be
afraid I've got two guys now with with tax bills well over a million dollars each wow and they're doing the Boe and
of course the tax department is fighting hard no no we don't accept that and I just keep on telling them stay strong do
this send this back and wait don't contact them now this is
another mistake a lot of people make they send the Boe in they don't hear back for a little while and they say oh
I better ring them up and find out what's going on Never follow up it's
their job let them follow and then if they do come back to you then you decide how you're going to fight back if
necessary but don't don't do their job for them no because I presume there's a
chance they won't come back you know they they quietly settled it that their sales they've they've used the financial
instrument they may have even securitized it and bonded it and made more money but um as long as they're not
hassling you why bother live your life have fun yeah
absolutely also um I mean you've proved that haven't you well this is it I mean
for me I set I for my own personal um uh knowledge I've set a precedent it worked
they and then they came back and obviously as a result of a video presumably a lot of people have gone to
the same company and other companies and they've gone hang on all of a sudden we're getting a flurry of these bloody things we've got to push back you know
somebody would have put a memo down and said no no we can't accept all of this and so they they are and and they will
know that most people will acques and go oh okay I'll pay by ordinary means but
as you say by staying firm and saying well actually I have actually settled the account and and in my case
where they pushed back on the second one I said look at no point have I said I'm
not settling this at no point have I said no I have settled the account but if that's not satisfactory send the
financial instrument back and of course they don't they've either I mean in my mind they've either shredded it or
thrown it away by the minion who opened the letter and I don't know what this is um or they've gone yeah thanks very much
we'll take that but we'll see if we can get some extra money out the chap yeah and as you found out with your water
bill um they settled the account and but they never sent you a receipt no all
they did was prove with the next bill it was settled exactly the the next so it
it it does work and you've got to stand firm and in your skin and say look I
mean I havn't I didn't tell them that you did it previously I didn't want to sort of get them worried by that because
they may go oh yeah actually if you could pay that one now as well I didn't want to no no that's it that's it they
can't do anything about it it's the law that's very important and and that's
their law I mean I suppose when we say law it's it's their legislation that we that we're using yeah I'm going to share
the screen again because there's another very important website I want everybody to have a look at it's called Lip
forms.com lip forms is live in private now this is run by a colleague of mine we work very
closely together and in fact uh every Thursday we do a a zoom call at 600 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time Australia anyone in the world can join and today I was actually talking to him and suggesting
that we do three zooms a week one uh on Australian time one on American time and
one on European time so that people around the world can have access to us and our our ideas and help so
right now if you come up here useful info you find that there's an awful lot
of good stuff in here that um uh explains a lot of things and we're you
know we're constantly updating this we're constantly learning and as we do we put it all on here so these are the
we webinars with Michael rol he's my uh my colleague uh and it explains so much
so what is a birth certificate what's the set KV trust uh a prisser note now
here's an interesting thing what's the difference between a promissary note and a
Boe okay a promissary note is um an also a financial instrument but you must have
the money to back it up somebody must back that prisser note because you're promising to pay right so don't don't
try and settle bills with a promissary note unless you have the money to pay it back use a bill of exchange so as you
can see Mike and I do quite a lot of um videos together um and he also runs a
things called the um royal royal royal registry um these are the
Commonwealth Consolidated acts and they're all here so you can read all of
the the most important sections here and I'll be putting that on my website too
um very important that you educate yourself so you don't make silly
mistakes okay yeah now there's a little um little video I recorded a while back
and he really liked it so if I may I'd just like to play this it's only two minutes so for Rebellion it's the act of
rebelling against the government that is no longer serving We The People by refusing to do what they tell us
lawfully now the bills of exchange act allows us to stop giving them our hard
earned money they do not deserve it traitors should not be paid for their
actions against us after Richard vbes released the video to tell everybody
that the Boe bill of exchange has worked for him I've been inundated with people
asking how to do it and does it work overseas if your country has a central bank it comes under UCC rules and those
UCC rules include settlement of accounts by a bill of exchange so what is a bill
of exchange take out any note from your wallet look at it that is a bill of Exchange change if you're in another
country apart from Australia you'll have to read the act in your country but it's not hard to read and the language is
very simple in Australia the relevant parts are UCC 3- 603 and the bills of
exchange act 1909 sections 22 and 68 but
I highly recommend you read the whole act so you understand exactly how it works it's very simple to do just go on
to my website C now. com.au and look for this picture on the
front page The Great Fire of London it's very simple to do follow the instructions on the website and send the
letter off they will more than likely write back to you and say we don't
accept that form of payment but that is wrong isn't it because we know now a bill of exchange is any form of payment
where we sign a check and the bills they send you are actually checks if you look at the top onethird of any fine that
they send you it looks very much like a check doesn't it and how do you pay a check you endorse it with your signature
and it's that simple I had the electricity company and spur come after me a couple of times and they refused to
accept my settlement at first but when I wrote back and asked them are they exempt from the law they suddenly
stopped going after me and they accepted the payment now how do I know that they've accepted the payment well my
first electricity bill was over $900 I sent them a v e they bucked and carried
on wrote me letters then I got a second bill for a much lower amount and that
means that they've accepted the first payment so don't be afraid and we deny the government the finance it needs they
make billions of dollars every year from our fines and those fines are illegal the Constitution does not allow the
government to LY fines against us at all in fact the only way that the government can Finance itself is through Import and
Export duties that's it so so everybody in Australia let's deny these governments our money and let's tear
down their system so that we can get back to proper government of the People by the people for the people lawfully
you will find the letters that you need to send to these GC people on lip forms.com on the right hand side down
here you'll see Bill of exchange and watch this video it's very educational and read all of this but this is the
first letter that you sent back basically it's an acceptance letter telling them you're happy to pay and
here is the Bill of exchange for the settlement if they come back and say no we don't accept that then you send them
the second one a notice of default and opportunity to cure if they really get
nasty and keep on sending your letters send them the third one notice of default in dishonor and disle that
usually ends it right there it may go even further and they might want to put you into court so therefore you tell
them notice of pending La SE and that's all there is to it unlock the secrets
they don't want to know fantastic wow yes all right
so thanks yeah no thanks for that that's a that's a fascinating and and you know
um it's your website has um come on a lot since we last spoke there's lots of information there for people and if they
read all of that it certainly helps you and indeed me when people come come back cuz I've had loads of people asking
questions because there's only you know us um to answer those questions and when
you're inundated it's great that then there's a web resource so that people can actually do a lot of the work and
they get the they get the information immediately right and you know the thing is uh Richard um I don't mind hearing
from anybody around the world if they they just want a little reassurance or have I done the right thing please don't
be shy about getting in touch with me my email is Mike holow sorry um Mike mikal
show.com Mike mikol show.com yeah that's my podcast

you and there we go um where were
we oh yeah the message to starma is Mother weers
uh where are we here oh yes here in in in this one here
this is the Boe page you wouldn't believe how many comments are below this article let me just go down here uh
actually before I do there are two videos on here this one here this is
between me and Michael talking about all of this and explaining it and then down the bottom here is one with Michael
tellinger who's from South Africa and I'm sure a lot of heard of him yes
had have you oh good yeah he's he's a very smart man and uh he explains it so
beautifully and then you come down here we got 367 comments
wow so uh um yeah a lot of comments a lot of questions and a lot of people
helping to answer so do go on to the website educate yourself and then if you
still can't find the answer please contact me you're welcome to do so
that's very that's very uh good of you um I know what it's like I mean I'm traveling around a bit doing talks and
various things and so I come back and my email bin is is very very full and you're desperately trying to answer
messages and people then write to you again say didn't you see my message he's like it's not that I didn't see it I
just haven't reached it yet that's right what was the same for me when I was down sick last week I came back and my email
oh God yeah but try try to get to them
uh at at the end but of course it's helpful if people go and read as much as they can first because that will speed
up the process for them as well more importantly right and the more knowledge you have the easier it gets yes
absolutely we we have been so ignorant for so long I mean this stuff really should be taught in schools assuming
schools were good places to send boys and girls which they've certainly turned
into not very good places um but this stuff should be taught from an early age age so that people know how to navigate
the world but of course it doesn't suit doesn't suit their purpose no and I'm
actually preparing something for my girls I at two daughters and I'm going to send them a few things on this whole
thing because they think Dad's a mat yes well my my uh my oldest son thinks I'm a
my other two on the other hand they're coming round and I was telling them
about bills of exchange and and legal fictions and and they were very intrigued so that was encouraging you
know and if we can get the younger people to be intrigued and look and and just try because that's the other thing
is it doesn't hurt to even if you you send it off and they say we don't accept it and then you get a bit cold feet you
can still pay it you know you're not going to suddenly go to court because you've just tried something you say oh
okay but then you can try it again you know why not that's the thing um and I
think that's what people think they they get to that point but I tried it it doesn't work until until they end it and
then if they get frightened because they people are saying oh we're going to send the debt collectors well just pay that bill and then the next bill comes in
start the process again right I heard you had some guy on your show who was actually saying that or it didn't work
right yes no I'm just trying to remember who that was interv so many people um doesn't but what was the upshot um well
on I can't remember if if what he said um if he said it didn't work and then may have done something else um some
people have have been we've had people on talking about promiser notes and and using those which is an interesting um
thing that you just said there make sure you've got the money the a chat called Dave Silva came on the show and he said
that he now this would be interesting to get your take on this because he was saying in his promisory note um on the
actual note it would say I promis to pay the bearer the sum of uh Sterling
Silvera and I thought for God's sake don't say that because if they come back and say
well all right then pay that Sterling still if it's £5 of Sterling s if the value of
whatever it is you're paying for is5 sterling silver is going to be about
2,500 now maybe more yeah so if you're promising to
pay5 in weight of sterling silver for A5 in cash you're going to end up up paying
astronomical amounts yeah so I I was I was nervous about that so I actually had
to sort of talk to him about he's coming back on with he puts a letter that goes with that to say you know you can claim
this5 pound whatever the promiser note is as soon as the bank of England um
says we'll deliver on our promise so he's put a sort of Proviso in there fair
enough um that's move and of course the bank of England will never will never never honor their promises because they
don't say what they promise they just promise 5 pounds of well it could be moldy potatoes who knows what it is
exactly you know ites it's not it's no longer backed by anything it's just an empty
promise um yeah this is right and if you take a a bank note out of your wallet I don't know if you've got it over in the
UK but it says used to say we promise to pay it doesn't on the Australian notes
anymore it just is $5 right let me find um here we I've got A10 note here oh you're blush I know
going to say well it depends what you call Rich isn't it if it's an empty promise so tiny tiny writing it says I
promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of10 10 of
what yeah no the whole the whole banking system and the financial system is a
sham and they've been fooling us for years and ever for 5,000 years if you go
back to Samaria right yeah
talk Talking of things in the UK you're having some really serious social
problems over there aren't you oh we are in all sorts of areas is any is any
area that specific that catches your mind well I mean you've got the the Muslims you know taking over streets and
bowing down and all that and fighting in the streets and raping girls is disgusting
we do have um yes and and of course all of this is wound up by you know stirred
up um divide and conquer is what is going on you know and so we are being uh
forced to take an opinion that he and they are the enemy and and yeah different cultures have different um
ways of doing things and it's not the English or the British culture and maybe those cultures should stay in their own
land where it may be acceptable but what's happening is that we are
infighting against people in this instead of turning around and pointing at the people who are doing the stirring
the government and the globalists that's right that's that's the biggest problem they've got us with this divide and
conquer um and and so we have had riots on the streets and and all of this and
you can't help feeling this is not only is it deliberate but it's going to escalate yeah I'm sure it is that's what
they want they want you to go to and you may be forced to because remember we
Brits we took over the whole world without even trying we didn't go out
there and say oh we're going to conquer the world we just want to go and make a little bit of money and in the in the
conquest in the process we ended up ruling most of the world so they better
be very careful we we get very nasty when uh we're pushed to the wall and
they have pushed us to the war far enough and starma boy oh boy he he's in
for a lot of trouble he may not but there's a lot of karma coming back for
him now I lived in Thailand as you know for 30 years and after a few years I'd
been there and i' was married to a tye girl um I used to go in to renew my Visa
every year and the the immigration officers would say look you've been here
a long time why don't you change and become a Tha citizen I say look at
that do I look TI you know am I going to travel around on a tie
passport no the looks that you would get well what I'm making here is that you
can't um mix the the cultures no if you're in this culture stay in your
culture right you can be friendly with other cultures but don't invite them into your home to live
that was the problem with the UK they invited out of you know oh we're sorry
we we uh conquered India we'll let you all in now and look at what's happened what a mess yes well I mean this does
seem to be the problem and it is a very difficult thing for people to um get their mind over I think in some ways
because they think when you talk about this you suddenly then now becoming racist and and all of that and that's
not what we're talking about we're talking about different cultures people do things in different ways and some
cultures work in their land according to their traditions and Customs but they don't mix when you take
people from one side of the world into another side of the world ins significant numbers and that's right you
know that's the that's the problem it's all right people coming in if they will say you know oh this is your culture
okay well we'll do what you but when they start changing again okay your religion now is being shunted over here
cuz we're bringing our ideas in in in huge numbers and in huge ways to
obliterate and and we you know the English people have seen that where
Christmas for example has been a winter festival because we suddenly become all
very nervous about offending people for something that has been a custom and a tradition for generations and then we
get a little bit oh we better change the name of this regardless whether you're
religious or not it's just been a tradition that has been we've been
brought up with yeah well I I was very L lucky when I went to Thailand I um got
an apartment right in the center of Bangkok and it was just full of ties so
every night I would take my guitar and a bottle of whiskey up on onto the roof and the ties would come up and they'd
bring tie food and tie whiskey and um we sing and and you know do all sorts of
things have fun together eat and they would teach me Thai culture as well as
the Thai language so my first year in Thailand I was just totally immersed and I was happy to do it because I was in
their country and you know over the years I worked in Thailand I was really
really grateful for that integration process because it it made it very easy
for me to live there um in fact I grew so good at speaking Tha sometimes I was
doing business on the phone with a Tai guy talking tight and you know halfway
through the conversation he'd go hang on a minute you're a foreigner so that's it but that I mean
that's what makes traveling around the world a pleasant and interesting experience because you go from your
culture to somebody else's culture and you can look at it and go wow look at this I love that aspect I love that you
know and you might take little bits from it back with you and and share that but when you become homogenized
as indeed they want us all to be you take away and even in even in just
England itself we used to have well we have regions but you would have Regional
accents and I was talking to this only this morning to Julia and my partner you used to have places that you would go
and there would be different types of food or different products like the Molton mry pork pie or a Cornish pasty
and you know very simple thing and as you travel around your own country there would be different traditions and
different things how people now with the corporations you can have a a burger
anywhere in the world and they always taste the same and it's bland you just you know you've blandis everything and
all those Exquisite things that was interesting so that you travel a 100 miles and suddenly go oh wow look at the
the architecture is different the people are somewhat different and it's interesting and fascinating and and all
they've done now is Amalgamated everything and every town looks the same Seaside towns here now look like inner
urban towns and and that's you know that's where the uglification of Britain has been happening and it seems to be
happening around the world it is I I've traveled a lot I was actually born in Western
supermare back County Somerset there we are Seaside Town yes and um I I remember
going to another town a few miles away I couldn't understand them that's it but
of course they couldn't understand me either that be right hello there then oh
yeah and and and and whilst you you know the world moves on and we do progress
It's the speed and the um the the the
planning to sort of strip away people's um Roots I was going to say
identification but I think it's people's roots and and the families and how they've done they managed to do it with
the universi splitting up families and and kids go off to University and then end up hundreds of miles away living up
there so the parents can't visit quite as frequently and we've just seen this
whole globalization to make us all of anywhere rather than from somewhere
that's right yeah and a lot of people here now because of this um scamdemic um
a lot of people are woken up here we were about to have an election last election I think it was about 36% of the
population refused to vote I'm looking forward to seeing how many won't vote this time I certainly won't be yeah but
um you know people are waking up and I think that was one of the the biggest benefits of this the pandemic was all of
a sudden what's going on here we're losing our freedoms and so people are
they're coming to us and saying well what can we do about this well one way is to use the Boe but there are plenty
of other things we're coming up with too and I'm I'm getting invitations now to go and speak at festivals and all sorts
of things this weekend I'll be at a um um a market we'll have our own stall
there and we've got this nice big red Marquee and with common LW across it and
we've also um uh published our own newspaper the corruption whistle
whistleblower and I'll see if I can find that for you where is it yeah do show that we have the light paper over here
yeah we paper yep there it is let me just bring it up to the top here I'll
share the screen now this thing is fantastic
because this is going to play a large part remember I was talking before about being able to access our set trust yes
part part of the process because it's about a three-month process part of the process is that you have to publish your
um paperwork in the newspaper of course not none of the MSN will do it now we've
got our newspaper so you can read the
newspaper uh online so you have to be a subscriber it cost you $5 to subscribe
and then uh you can read the newspaper so let me just show you how it works and oh that's the wrong one hang
on I'm already a member so I'll just go there should be a member I made the
thing
know right and there she goes and there it is
you can read it online here or you can order it
so just go here and like that and there it all is so um and this thing is a
keeper you don't just take it and throw it away the next day this is actually as it says on the front page it is a brief
of evidence and we have all the crimes they've committed and we're the next
one's going to be a real doozy because we're we're going to be talking about terrorism guess who the terrorism
terrorists are yeah well I think we're all beginning to work work that out AR we
yes now this is an interesting one because I I've done a lot of work figuring this one out this is Sir Henry
Talbert Gibbs and he was a high court judge and he said I therefore have come to the conclusion that the current legal
and political system in use in Australia and its states and territories has no
basis in law now that's a judge that's a judge saying that yep not many judges
have the balls to do that today but it's all look at this it's all in there and
if you do get a copy you can order a copy um although it's in paper form
somewhere here we'll have my my age
me it's a it's a good T of of reference isn't it it is it's 80 odd
Pages wow yeah so you know and of course we're
talking about trafficking child trafficking and all the rest of it yes
funny enough there's a lot of sink holes going over here they they're blowing up the the um the the the tunnels so they
yeah yeah we're starting to fight back now this is my page you can see my websites up here and that's the uh

must freeze to death this winter by uh stopping the winter payments um what a
lovely man he is you know he's really endearing himself to uh cuddles and and
and love um to the day his neck gets longer

15 years ago I thought to myself oh great I'm going to go fishing

um was a Vietnam sorry a World War II veteran who' been captured by the Japanese in Singapore and he had a
fantastic story to tell so I said mate I want to tell this story for you so I
published a book took us a year to write right and um uh it's called p
w921 it's a fantastic story because he told me at the end the uh Nagasaki bomb
saved their lives literally saved their lives because the Japanese High command
had come was ready to uh tell all the prisoners uh kill all the prisoners so
there was no no evidence and then of course they dropped the Nagasaki bomb straight after that all the Japanese put
their guns down and gave up just like that F just like that yeah wow what a
story um yeah well there we are something else to look for in the uh book sellers

box down the bottom connect to the antenna up the top with all the the
black uh lines going up yeah I hear they're very flammable they keep
bursting into flame in England too don't they do they I hadn't heard that I know EV cars blow up but um I I understand
that they can overheat heaven forbid something somebody said oh wouldn't it be a shame if expanding foam was put
