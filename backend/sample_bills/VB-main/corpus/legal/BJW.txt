hello everyone and welcome to Medicum Authentica
I'm your host Dr Andrew Calfman and tonight I'm not going to focus on natural health or germ theory or viology
but instead I'm going to have a discussion about law
with someone a very unique gentleman who I encountered his work only a month or two ago
but I've gone through uh his uh course an advanced course and um we were able to connect
and and uh we hit it off very well and we're both kind of pursuing uh similar things um in parallel 
And I'm speaking of the one and only Brandon Joe Williams who has come on the scene about a little 
over a year ago and developed quite a big following putting out free course material and 
really going uh on a deep dive into the law and not just one section but actually covering uh
 many different areas of law So you can see his material and get kind of a comprehensive uh 
 overlook of the areas that people are really uh researching And uh Brandon also even before 
 he studied law had some very interesting accomplishments He's the author of a couple of uh 
 books on marketing and relationships Um and he also has extensively uh um been a member of 
 the Church of Scientology uh done a lot of uh studying and really educated me on uh some of 
 the true um nature of what's going on in that church And of course it's uh not what everybody 
 thinks on the surface So I'm very pleased to welcome uh 
 Brandon Joe Williams Hello Hello Thank you My pleasure 
 And for your for your for your show just to be just to be clear uh you know it's 
 it sounds to me possibly like your show has a lot of medical professionals or or
  professional type people So my my platform is definitely uh very very wild and silly Uh I
   do have a couple of URLs that we can use instead of the main URL I have uh don'tbe slave.com 
and I have brandonjo.com But uh there definitely should be a bit of a disclaimer I will definitely
uh not be acting that way on this show but uh just a little disclaimer my platform is pretty shall
we say uh oh gosh how would we even describe my platform um I don't know you know you you use sort 
of uh a lot of adolescent male humor Yes Yes Yes Attract um you know the right audience I I I'm 
trying very hard to take just just as a background because I want to clear this up I don't want 
people to be oh what the what the heck is this guy um I I I I'm trying to take the subject of law
which which I am a marketing demographic person That's what my entire history is Marketing 
demographics lot of uh demographic research surveys literally going on the street with pens 
and clipboards uh for thousands and thousands of hours This is my background Um and I wanted 
to take the subject of deep dive law which as I progressed through my own studies I realized 
the average age of the individual interested in that was either a 70-year-old uh white person 
or a a 25year-old black man Uh literally that was like pretty much the entire demographic interested 
And it was either the the 70-year-old white person was was trying to change the way they see America 
going in the wrong direction and the younger black man was because he was in trouble with something
with litigation and he was trying to figure it out uh very very earnestly And I decided to myself 
that I wanted to expand that uh that demographic and I wanted to be uh try to push this information
into a much lower demographic I've gotten that demographic down to probably around early 30s I've been able to to stretch out that demographic all the way down to I'd say about 32 is probably I mean we we definitely get some teenagers and some 20-year-olds but it's it's really not But I've like solidly like seriously stretched the demographic all the way down to about 32 years old So for me my platform the entire purpose of that was to stretch out that demographic of which I have done successfully but it is extremely wild It's like a Jerry Springer show Well you know I mean to be honest right people generally don't want to sit down and read law books It's pretty it's pretty dry material right so yeah now of course there is the attraction of you know being able to really um have all the freedom that you deserve as a natural man and there is the attraction also of you know the financial aspects right you call it infinite money and but there has to you know like still even if we said oh you could get a million dollars if you read this you know law dictionary cover to cover I don't think too many people would do it So I think it's great using that technique and um you know because a lot of folks just need a a lightness about it to enter that and you know like for example when I saw you and Joe Lustika have that chemistry and the extreme sarcasm right it's like it just gives a casual context that you can talk about this and actually you know have fun like you know tonight we're going to talk about a lawsuit that I'm in and uh you know I'm not freaking out every day about having to you know go into court and present my case or anything like that It happens very slowly You have a lot of time you know to prepare and and do everything and uh you know um it's kind of a fun opportunity actually Oh yeah yeah yeah I mean to your point I am I am trying very hard to invite I'm trying basically my my my my whole goal what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to to kind of nail that center demographic which is where it's people who who aren't completely like I guess you could say like Tik Tok It's a little bit it's too much for me I can't I just can't do it Uh I don't want to do it Uh but I want to get like halfway to that point where it's like the people who who don't really want to read but what happens is they they they come across such uh um uh cat catalytic uh uh video or audio format content that it that it blasts them into a motivational level where they are or they are tearing through books I feel like it's it's I am the I am the the the gasoline's already there especially with the with the environment the way things are in the country right now The gasoline's already there I just want to be that spark And I feel like I feel like I've done a really good job of being a Jerry Springer show in a way where I can I I I create that spark and then the per that it creates that person to want to okay okay I'm willing to read now Do you see and I and I'm very good at that I will say I think I I think I've done a really good job of that specifically Well that I mean that's the most important thing because we're really you know we're getting at inspiration and you know that's really the only thing we can do from platforms like this right is inspire people to uh take their own action by setting an example by you know using whatever uh devices are at our disposal So you know I commend you for having such a a large reach in such a short time Um it really shows that uh you know there is a strong desire out there and hopefully we'll provide some further uh enriching content uh the rest of this discussion Love it So should I kind of uh set things up or do you want to talk about any more general things uh it's up to you Uh you you are a lot more aware of your demographic than I am Uh whatever you think would be best Well you know I'm not really sure who is going to be interested in this I think it's going to reach uh perhaps you know definitely in my audience people are interested and I do talk about this on my platforms on my private platforms but this is a little bit broader and you know I've really been uh Brandon looking at all of the people out in the space I mean I'm sure I haven't identified everyone but there are quite a number of folks talking about all kinds of issues related to for example uh consumer credit uh different types of loan related transactions and credit cards a lot of things about passports driver's license uh you know status of as a US citizen and all this material And many of the processes that people teach right they always say that you know you may not be successful so you have to be ready to sue or to be sued at some point But there's not a lot of folks that seem to have experience um actually going through the litigation or teaching about specific uh strategies and I know this is uh an area that you're getting into in your focus as well So um that's why I thought this would be a a good discussion to have because uh what occurred is that I was um following some process using negotiable instruments that were sent to me you know by a credit card uh bank and sending them in in a way that I think is an appropriate way to pay And I think the starting point we have to realize is that in our entire banking and a financial system since 1933 there's no real money in terms of something of tangible value like gold and silver coin which you know in the constitution section 1 article 10 right is the uh money or the official legal tender of the United States government but um through the emergency uh legislation in 1933 that was taken out of the system And since that time all we have is paper There's no real thing of value And once you understand exactly what that paper is based on and how it's created you realize that you can't pay in any way a meaningful way with anything of value all you can do is uh move this paper uh around the system according to the rules And so we are trying as a community right to learn the rules of how this works and what our place is And we don't all have exact right answers yet And partly taking action in the courts is going to help us learn those answers because the judgment that will occur will tell us what you know if we're right or if we're not right Yes So there is some risk involved And so by taking action like this and trying to you know use this paper in the the appropriate way um I ended up getting sued by the bank And I'm not going to give the names of the parties right now because I'm pro if I don't have to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the future I'm going to uh release everything publicly because it'll be on the public record Um and so I was served you know with papers and had to figure out how to respond And it it's still early on but we're but I did write a response with all my defense strategies counter claims uh included Uh so we can talk a little bit about that and I'll tell you what Yeah Say a couple things here cuz Yeah please do A lot of things here I'd like to just cover a couple things here Uh so first and foremost just to be clear uh you know for a long long time I was trying to get compliance and and I was trying to get enforcement in other ways besides litigation because I I I am like everyone else I am not some superhero Uh that people think I am Uh I I'm the pickle man You know what I mean that's my uh people think I'm a superhero but I'm really not Uh I try to be as transparent as I can because I want people to realize that I have the human experience no different than they do I went through tremendous tremendous fear and terror and sleepless nights and difficulties with friends and being removed from all sorts of things that I care about very much Uh so it's one of those things where um I you know it's been a long road I I've been able to get us up to maybe 15 to 20% of the time we're able to get some sort of headway with these various activities Uh but there's absolutely no pattern to it whatsoever It's just like um just shooting completely in the dark Uh you you one person may get wonderful results You do the exact same thing You send it to the exact same place with all the exact same paperwork done with the exact same pen You could send the freaking pen in the mail and and and this exact same thing The stickers for the the parcel It could be the same cardboard for the freaking everything could be exactly the same You could do you could do molecule searches and you know what I mean you could go and it just it's just you just never know what you're going to get It's it's just a dice You're rolling the dice right so so after a long time of avoiding litigation and and not wanting to get into it and finding it to be a very um um um what would you call it intimidating thing Uh I I I was just I just really for a long long time and then finally I started to realize that it's kind of like the only path left I I went from writing crazy weird things to drawing pictures to sending in Polaroids of me in in in silly outfits I have a bunch of silly outfits and onesies I mean I was doing it all I was doing phone calls I was doing faxes I was doing you know and and I just realized that um you know I realized a lot of things during that time period including the way in which I'm going to go about the litigation is very different than anybody's ever seen before Um so there are a lot of good things that have come out of that but it was just a realization that uh the way that the system looks at it is you're just kind of like a little barking dog a little barking chihuahua until you litigate and then once you litigate you're taken seriously as an adult It's basically like you're a child until you prove that you're an adult And you prove that you're an adult when when you can properly present yourself in a court of law That's just really and people can complain and and moan and freak out about that And uh I just I was never complaining about that I just didn't want to do it Uh until I realized that there's really not any other option uh and and if I really want to nail this thing down I'm going to have to become extremely proficient in this So I started studying day and night And I have been studying quite a lot for quite some time before I decided to kind of dip my feet in We just filed our first suit uh just a few days ago It's not even it's not they just received it at the uh at the court So there's a bunch that I'm going to be doing on my own and then I'm doing some for some of my clients I feel very confident in what I can do in the court system I do not feel confident in the procedural aspect of the way that the court moves I'm starting to feel more confident because I study and I study and I study and I and I'm very adamant about clearing up all of the definitions of all the words which is very very important to me And so I am learning pretty rapidly and and I will be learning more rapidly as we move through the court system And I'm realizing that every lawyer that I come in contact with uh I I am literally stepping into the courtroom for the first time but I'm already uh uh 400 stories above every other lawyer I come into contract with And I that's something that I mentioned to you uh on the phone is that myself and you think in the same way We think that we need to be uh 10 star warriors before we enter the battle right and we're willing to put in the work even if that requires many many thousands of hours to do so What's happening is when we're arriving on the battlefield and realizing that everybody else in the battlefield is a one star we would have been fine as a three star but we're a 10 star And uh I think that is the one of the most important things for people to realize because it's a lot less intimidating than you think The the intimidation is an illusion It is entirely an illusion It is a It is a bunch of children with cardboard shields and and and they just kind of they're just kind of in diapers and they they they they're just they poop their pants and they're just running around and that's been my experience so far including a lot of the prosay people that I have had the pleasure to speak to So it is a very interesting field because I I I very much very very strongly want to create some sort of roydant course and give it away for free Uh describing all of this describing the mindset describing the procedure describing you know kind of everything the same way I did the contract killer course Uh that's in the near future of what I want to do So just to give a background on that I am just now very very seriously entering into the litigation atmosphere Yeah Well we we both are you know very uh similar in our thoughts about this and I was not rushing into it either In fact you know I I I feel myself fortunate now but you know the other party took action and sued me So that that kind of I didn't have a choice Yeah Right It's time to go And you know I I definitely agree that the the profession of attorneys right which is is different from what we're talking about here because they learn law from really a procedural aspect Yeah Right Civil procedure uh whereas they don't necessarily study the body of law to the same degree that we do So they're going to be largely ignorant of what we're talking about Now even some of the judges and I I already experienced this in the past when um I was an expert witness in mental health and we had cases before the court all the time and the judges didn't know the precedent cases um in that area even though they were regularly assigned these cases They didn't like even take the time to learn it and uh sometimes we had to educate uh the judge um about these matters Right So you may possibly be in that uh position The the one thing I would say though is that you have to be able to to understand what you're doing and back it up So for example if you walk into a courthouse or a county clerk's office to file documents right and um like I had this uh this happened to me Now I will tell you that I'm actually um wrote my paperwork and filed it as agent for my all caps name as the defendant Right So good I'm not that person Um because that's an abstract you know corporate entity or trust and in order to file the affidavit of service So you know you have to guarantee that when you file documents in a court case they actually get to all the parties and they there are special paperwork to certify that you actually sent it to them and that they actually received it And so this affidavit of service is that document and the defendant you know quote unquote is not allowed to certify that affidavit right because it's a conflict of interest However when I went to um affirm that document um they said "Oh you can't You're the defendant." And I said "No I'm not the defendant I'm the agent for the defendant as principal." And I said "I have a power of attorney document to back that up if you'd like to see it." And that's all I needed to say And then he's like "Oh no problem sir." And then he notorized it and then he filed it Right So all I had to do was just understand what I was doing and what the basis and have another you know either I could refer to a a statute or I could refer to a document that was the evidence needed to back up that claim And if you are prepared to that level um that's what you need to be You don't have to know every law right you can always ask for a recess to prepare your response to something Uh everything moves very very slowly Um right In my case there's been uh three documents submitted two from the plaintiff and one from me and there's not even a judge assigned yet So and it the original uh filing was in September and now we're in January right so you you have plenty of time to um deal with these things Nothing is you know um uh immediate and and uh nerve-wrenching Um and I think the chance of actually having to go into court and testify is pretty low Although I would with these subjects Oh yeah I've I've known a lot of people I've talked to a lot of people and I've never heard of anything even close to a courtroom I mean even even close to a courtroom right well I think uh the only way you're really going to go there is if you file in small claims court And um that actually may be uh a worthwhile um tactic for some cases where the amount is you know low enough to do that uh because there you can just basically tell the the judge what's going on and if you explain it properly uh you may very well be successful Yeah Yeah It's exciting So in this case uh we have the credit card bank um filing suit and interestingly on the top of their um summons it says consumer credit transaction right and so for example if you go to file in federal court there'll be a form uh to submit your complaint and on there it'll ask you which section of the law is relevant to your suit and one of those choices is consumer credit So it right this is definitely an area where there's commonly litigation occurring Um and then here's an interesting thing that if you get sued by a you know so-called creditor that they the law tries to favor them and and um by if you're scared and you don't do anything about it they get what's called a default judgment So they give you they write this on all the papers of course but they say you know you have 30 days or 60 days or 20 days whatever it is to respond and if not right basically the judge will say you know guilty So just respond even if your response is you know I need more time that they'll they'll give you more time Uh but don't you know shoot yourself in the foot by uh just giving away the money So now the cause of action here that they sued for is kind of interesting So they mentioned a couple of things So one is Do you want to do you want to talk about what that means cause of action at all yeah Yes Yes So the cause of action is the actual basis for the lawsuit right so if you are going to initiate a lawsuit right you have to have a cause of action Like it could be for example breach of contract Um because all if you're talking about litigation in finance right there's always a relationship There's a bank or you know creditor and a borrower or a loaner and a borrower Um so in that case um the you know the cause of action could be related to a breach of contract because there's always a contract between the borrower and the lender But there are other causes of action Um but but you you know this is also that in the law itself if you search these different causes of action and this may vary by state or federal jurisdiction that there might be specific criteria to meet uh the burden of proof for that cause of action Now with breach of contract that's kind of wide and you know contract law is pervasive and it's a massive uh subject and it's definitely something you know I would say that there you need to understand contract law and trust law to at least a basic level of proficiency to really be able to handle these matters um in terms of litigation Yeah But but it's not those are not very complicated Uh they're just probably and contracts you know are something that we we enter into all the time They may not be on paper and actually the law says that they don't have to be expressed on paper Yeah Um right So anytime you know Brandon um gosh will like I would love to talk to you Will you do my show and then I'll give you a copy of it to put on your channel Right We just we just made a contract right there as long as he agrees Yeah And like if you're let's say even if you're driving a car you have a duty the way the way the law looks at it you have a duty to make sure you're not running people over with your car right even that even that is sort of like a it's not quite looked at as a contract but it almost kind of is because it's sort of like by driving that car there there is sort of like this unspoken contract that you have a duty not to run people over on the crosswalk right so the cause of action for being run over by the crosswalk is that there was a duty uh you know that duty was breached I mean it wouldn't it wouldn't come up as a breach of contract necessarily on the actual paper but but everything like you're saying it's true everything that you're doing is some sort of contract Um every time you communicate with someone every time you purchase something every time you uh speak to someone I mean even speaking to someone and and increasing or decreasing their emotional tone in a way could be considered some sort of emotional exchange contractual emotional exchange That's that's getting a bit esoteric but I'm just trying to uh point out that that really everything literally everything I mean breathing is a contract if you really want to get down to it Anything that exchanges anything between anything pretty much you know Yeah So breathing is what a contract between you and the air Well you you could say it as a contract that you know you're you're converting uh oxygen into carbon dioxide and and you're exchanging that carbon dioxide with trees you know Uh yeah So that's good It's a contract with the plants because you give them CO2 they give you back oxygen right exactly Yeah That's a really good uh good one And it also helped people understand the hoax of climate change Yes Oh god Yes That's a big one Yeah So they listed um uh two causes of action um on this uh well actually yes first and second Now the first one is kind of interesting because it it's essentially breach of contract They say that you know I violated the card member agreement by failing to make periodic payments as required Right Now here it's the definition of payment uh that perhaps is a key issue to understand how they could make that claim Yes Um but in order to establish themselves um as upholding their end of the bargain of that agreement uh they first say that they basically I applied and received a credit account which they own which is true They own the account Um and that they are the original creditor Now this is where um I believe fraud comes in because the original creditor means that they are the source of the assets uh that are lent or provided as as credit Yes Okay So that's the first cause of action right so as original creditor u they fulfilled their contractual duties and obligations but as a card member I did not uh because I failed to make payments Now the second cause of action is kind of interesting and it's really defensive on their part where they basically say that they sent me periodic statements and that I did not object to them Okay Um and what that really means is that the there was no dispute on the account because um according to federal law if the account is under dispute they are not allowed to pursue collection services And this lawsuit would be considered a collection services right in fact on the top of their complaint they say this is I believe they say this is an attempt to collect a debt So they wouldn't be allowed to do that if it was in dispute So they're pretty much saying this defensively Oh you didn't dispute these bills Therefore we have a right to sue you But that's not the case either actually Yeah I just didn't dispute it in uh perhaps the way that they recommended on the back of their billing statements Yeah Well they don't you know we we we have a lot we have hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of people doing all this stuff right now They don't get it We We had one just today I mean every single day I see something new right from Bridgeest Uh I think it's a mortgage I could be wrong I think it's a mortgage And they say right on the response that they do not accept promisary notes And I just fell out of my chair I was laughing so hard that would void the mortgage uh because the mortgage mentions a negotiable instrument right in it Well Federal Reserve notes are promisary notes So they they literally just told you they will not be accepting Federal Reserve notes So now you get to a point now where you say "Well how you want gold and silver coins what do you want?" You know what I mean i can't pay you anymore You're you're saying "I cannot physically pay you." Which is so funny because UCCC3 is very clear that you you cannot refuse uh any negotiable instrument payment which would be you know any type of promisary note any sort of uh a promise to pay any sort of written signed promise to pay any sort of bill of exchange which would be an order to pay you they cannot actually um deny these things and actually there's a section of UCCC 3 that states that once you even offer these things to them they even if they do reject it or do not accept it Then whatever amount that you offered which is called a tender whatever amount that you tendered or offered is actually instantaneously removed off of the account as though it's a payment even if the the so-called payment is rejected So it's actually very very funny Uh you simply has to be made in good faith So So all these letters there's all these letters that are being sent out So many letters I see letters every single day and they always say the same thing They say blah blah blah you sent this thing in It's not real We don't accept this kind of payment Uh you know we you still owe us blah blah blah blah blah It's pretty much that's the communication every single time Uh we're starting to see now a little bit more detail uh the Bridgecraft one and a couple other ones I've seen they they go even farther and they say we do not accept any special or restrictive endorsements such as and they go on to say paid in full They go on to say uh uh negotiable instruments They'll say that right in the letter Some some letters I've never seen that before They're starting to get more specific which is all still completely completely false information but I do find it interesting that we're starting to see a little bit more detail in these letters Well that is quite interesting And you know I mean this is an area that's very important to bring up I mean we we weren't necessarily going to talk about discovery but there's something called interrogatories where you can submit a list of questions to the other party um basically to you know get at evidence of how they're going to yes address those issues and so asking some simple questions because they so for example I've seen in court court testimony uh one time and and I think this might have been a small claims court where The judge asked the uh it was a plainif who was suing in this case I believe or maybe they were the defendant also actually um you know did you pay in US dollars now this is quite interesting because all the negotiable instruments that we're talking about they're all denominated in US dollars right they in fact the the coupon on your monthly credit card bill right it has a dollar sign right on it So there's really no difference uh between any of these things They they accept checks right so you can't say a check is a is a dollar bill Federal Reserve note but it's US dollars because that's what it's denominated in right it's not uh a foreign currency So any of these instruments they're all equivalent They're all denomin You're not going to write you know uh to pay in yuan on there or rupees You you could though you could though and they have to accept it actually You could you could because those are all negotiable instruments as well They may have charge an fee for exchange but but nevertheless right be so this but this guy got nervous when the judge asked him this and he said no and then boom right after that it was like case over you didn't pay in US dollars right now he didn't say well you know I only had uh some croners and so hold on a second you're saying the defendant the defendant was asked that question uh uh and then the defendant said no the defendant was the one who tried to use an instrument to pay I think that's too bad That's too bad because he did pay in US dollars because the definition the definition of US dollars is very very simple It's one of two things or both because you could you could technically use both to to as a as a payment for US dollars It's either a bill of exchange which is defined as an unconditional order to pay or it's a promisary note which is defined as an unconditional promise to pay Federal Reserve notes are promisary notes Uh everything every currency pretty much is some sort of promisary note There's only a few countries left that have real currency So the thing is that you could send in any promisary note You can even manufacture promisary notes and by definition that would be a payment for US dollars And the and the and the the exact reference on that would be 18 USC8 which is uh obligations or other securities of the United States where they go they're very clear that all promisary notes bank notes bills of exchange are all obligations or other securities of the United States Right so you know this is a very good point and let me just break it down in simple as possible for people that all of the things that we think of are money are all negotiable instruments Yes And there's only there's two kinds of negotiable instruments right there's as Brandon called it bills of exchange And we generally don't use that term as much in the United States anymore It's generally referred to as for foreign negotiable instruments But drafts is another word that you could use and that is an unconditional order to pay And the other kind are notes or promisory notes They mean the same thing and that's an unconditional promise to pay So you have an order to pay and a promise to pay Right so that's simple When we have a a dollar bill a Federal Reserve note that is a note So it's a promise to pay and a check which we and we write a check that is a type of draft or related to a bill of exchange and that is an order to pay and we're actually ordering the bank who holds the account to pay the payee whoever that is Yeah So so bills that you receive in the mail such as a bill that you receive from your uh utility company it's called a bill And whenever you see the word bill or billing department that is a shortening for the full term called bill of exchange Those statements or those bills or those the reason why they are called bills is because they are unconditional orders to pay a fixed amount with or without interest It says "Pay uh $57 by January 21st." That right there is an unconditional promise to pay That actual bill that you receive at the end of the month is actually a you could actually convert that bill and send it in You could take a bill from your telephone company you can write some things on it and you can mail it to your water company and it's actually a payment for US dollars That's how insane That's how insane the system that we have is Brandon let's just give an example like that people know from their everyday life of how you know you can do this because you know we've all written checks right so checks is a negotiable instrument that you can write on right you can write in the memo section You can you have your endorsement on the back and you can actually if someone writes a check to you you can actually write instructions on there to another party Yes Right So there's all kinds of things that that you can do You just never kind of were given this rulebook And here's here's the They don't want you to have it That's right It's the biggest thing It's the biggest thing on the entire planet that they don't want you to have I mean I know you guys talk about a lot of things and and and the medical stuff and all that stuff This what we're talking about right now on on the the top 10 list of things they do not want you to have This is probably number one on all their lists That's right So so these bills of exchange that they send you every month right notice they have the positive balance on there And here's where the confusion comes from right you think they're ordering you to pay them but it may be that actually a different party is ordering a different party to pay And so that's what you know what we have to figure out It's that's in with an order to pay There's three parties So we have to figure out you know who's in each role and where do we fit in and then we can properly write the correct instructions on that and basically it becomes a check Yeah Right Which I say use that term because it's familiar to you It may be you know a demand draft or uh technically a slightly different thing but essentially it's a check And even if you look at those coupons on the bottom they have a string of numbers on the bottom And the leftmost number is nine digits right which is a routing number Now if you try to look that up under bank routing numbers you won't find it because it's a private routing number Um and then you'll find after that the account number and also in there is often the amount of the minimum payment right just like on a certified check So that really contains all the elements of the check And you can find this written about in the federal law um under uh the treasury regulations So you can look for treasury circular 300 which is the prior version Uh but it's an extensive document that you can find for download And also in the CFR the code of federal regulations if you look up uh the area around restrictive endorsement you'll find um they give you instructions of how you can give different instructions on these bills And they'll also describe what the coupon is and give instructions about tearing it off or not tearing it off and uh about endorsing it So you can you know actually find these things in the law not you know we're not just making this up and hoping that it's a check It it's right in there Uh what we just may not know is the exact best way how to write these instructions and exactly who is the best individual to send it to to process it And that's where we're running into the kind of problems uh compliance and enforcement right right So so for example I sent uh the instruments myself to several parties but primarily to the chief financial officer of the bank Uh but I also sent a copy to the regular billing department and also on the bill itself they list some additional numbers that you could send in certain circumstances So I sent it to all those places Um so that way you know there's redundancy and uh maybe someone might know you know what to do with it although they didn't uh really know But they never refused any of these instruments They didn't send it back and ask for something different Uh they really mostly ignored it They they did send correspondence asking for another uh power of attorney uh from a separate department within the bank That's interesting I've never seen that Interesting Okay And then they did send me notice that they closed my account so I could pretty common Yeah you were using the card and ultimately they sent me a charge off notice which is basically what they do is on their accounting books they write off the debt Um so their books are balanced and it it doesn't show up as a loss or liability However they still pursue collection So even after doing that they still that's when they decided to sue me um to uh collect you know what they think are unpaid debt Yeah And then just to give my my same same situation same story I did American Express for $177,000 I had uh on two cards business cards um like multiple businesses and and we kind of racked it up and then I around 90,000 These were under your personal uh social security credit not on a business credit right yeah And um we were at about 90,000 and I said "You know what f it I'm going to I'm going to just crank this thing up as high as I can go." I went on a shopping spree I had a blast I I furnished my whole apartment bought a brand new TV I bought all this great stuff Uh computer parts and and and car parts and all sorts of good stuff desks and uh I think even the camera I'm on right now I bought during that Uh and and then uh also running a business and running a couple businesses and and all sorts of good stuff We got up to about 177,000 and then um and then I went for it I said I'm gonna I'm gonna this is it I'm gonna go for it Uh I was very scared I sent them this was a this was a long time ago I didn't know a lot about a lot of this stuff And I just sent them this freaking 25 page freaking uh story book It was like a It was like a a a It was like something out of a It was like a a combination of a story combination of a of a philosophy text combination of a of a love a love letter combination of a hate letter It was just this like craziness And it had this whole thing about how I I I'm trying so hard to learn all this and I'm I'm going out there and I'm I'm helping to you know re rekindle America and rekindle the original America and I want American Express to be a part of it and I'm willing to uh uh actually help American Express be the pre premier uh creditor of the new world And I was just like I was just like went off Right This this reminds me of the Jerry Magcguire memo Yeah Is that right i I don't think I've ever seen that Yeah Oh sorry Yeah that was the the main story right he was uh working at this uh fancy sport uh you know coaching thing where they had all the premier uh clients and he writes this memo and it's very inspirational like about you know we can make this a great industry and such like that And then they all basically said get out of here You're fired That's that's basically what I did Uh I didn't know any better I was more of a writer than a litigator Uh so I went through my writing uh eyes you know what I mean and I was like okay I'm going to impact them through my writing right and I just go on and on and on about you know and it's all in my course I have the whole video breaking down this particular document Uh now I look back and I kind of chuckle a little bit but it it was it was all part of the learning experience I have no regrets And then below that uh you know I talk about the different statutes and the different things that were violated and that kind of thing and I say you know there's going to be leans that I'll be filing if this is not complied with Uh but I was also very jokey and very light but then at the same time a couple of snippy parts in there I tried to keep it not this heavy nasty threatening thing Uh so so they sent me to Altran Collections and then they did hire an attorney a law office The law office sent me a letter I sent I sent well no I sent that that was the first letter I had sent then it went to collections then it went to the attorney and then I wrote up a whole another thing that I sent to all the credit credit agencies to all and then also the the lawyer and then they after I sent that second letter they everybody dropped everything and the lawyer actually sent me a letter and I posted that letter on my website and that letter says you know hey we've decided uh we're not admitting anything guilt we're admitting that we've done anything illegal or we're not admitting that all has done anything illegal but we all has made the business decision to not pursue this debt and we're also not going to report it And I have that actual physical evidence of that letter posted on my website on my on the course signup page If you scroll all the way down you'll see that letter So um I never I've never of all the crazy things I've done that was the closest I ever got to litigation and uh it never happened So but it's it's kind of like to your point it's sort of like well had it happened back then I probably would be a star litigator now because I would have been I would have been thrown into the middle of the ocean and I would have had to swim my way all the way to to the shore And honestly there's almost a part of me wishes they would have sued me Um I would have been learning I had a very similar experience that I was uh doing um a slightly different uh process uh based on equity um using the acceptance process for my property taxes on my uh prior home I still have it now But uh basically I began doing this and then I they basically sent me all these letters threatening tax foreclosure and uh then one of the uh the the assistant uh finance commissioner sent me this letter You know she said "Stop sending all these notices of acceptance and dishonor." And you could tell from this letter that she she didn't understand like she had never looked it up in the law that this is a real thing I think she thought I was just some guy making stuff up So so I decided it was the wrong the wrong people to talk to They're the tax collectors but they don't understand anything about the law So I found the county attorney who is in charge of property tax for the county And then I found out who in the state gets involved with this So I sent it to the state tax commissioner uh a copy and then also to um the controller of currency for the state and who they regulate financial matters and financial institutions And I sent a notice of default and I went through like all of the the law including tender of payment by the way which is a very powerful yeah um section of the law uh in these cases And once I sent that off I got no reply at all But I have not received any correspondence from them whatsoever related to any delinquent tax uh um uh bills or or liability So they just sent me the regular like bill for this year Uh but it didn't have any uh delinquent uh taxes on it So that is sort of not an outright victory where they kind of admitted that uh okay your taxes are paid Uh however they're they're not pursuing uh trying to steal my house So um and send me harassing letters So I consider that you know victorious uh for sure Yeah Totally So um I think one of the things um to understand uh when you are dealing with this is exactly what what your role is So I look at the you know my name in all capital letters as not exactly my name that that's an entity right perhaps even owned by some someone else like the government but that that's not the flesh and blood me because we don't write our names that way And I think everybody who's looked into this space kind of has heard about the straw man concept So in um you know signing and writing instructions on these negotiable instruments I did it as agent Right now agent is someone who has basically responsibility for entering into contracts for a principal in a trust Um and uh for doing basically like accounting and um you know those kinds of duties and the principal duty is actually to notify the principal of any notice that gets sent to the agent because they are like the liaison Now they're different from a trustee because a trustee is the one who has the fiduciary duties uh of the trust So in other words paying the bills and such In fact a lawsuit is really the trustes responsibility Um but we can sort of talk about that uh separately But by delineating clearly to the court that I am the agent and not the principal not the defendant because this lawsuit is against the all caps name it's not against me the man Um and that's what one of the ways to delineate that is to say that you're there by special appearance and in and that means only to argue the matters of law and that you have no personal liability And this is actually delineated in New York law So I was able to reference that But if now in order to actually be like accepted at by the judge as the agent um there might be some further things that you have to do So one possible way is if you have a power of attorney that is upheld Um but also there's a process called ratification But I just want you to know that if you're an agent and you get ratified which is something you can definitely achieve In fact I I think that when I was allowed to file that affidavit of service as agent that that actually ratifies me Um but Oh interesting But um nevertheless if you're ratified that means you have no liability whatsoever So in other words even if you lose the case uh the judge will look to the trustee another party to pay the damages not you because you're the agent So you're not the responsible party So this in in other words gives you immunity uh so to speak That's right Right And this is just similar to the concept and you know many people think that this is valid if you go back to the congressional record of 1933 that all the property is actually owned by the government and that we are the beneficial you could say the beneficial owners are the beneficial users of the property Right so the property is for for our pleasure um but and uh we are supposed to be good custodians right by taking care of it um and preserving it for the future but uh technically it's not ours and some evidence of this may be where um eminent domain for example where the government can come in and and renovate you know take your property for their own use uh they do compensate you for the inconvenience right but it's not it's not the same way you'd be compensated if you owned it You would be able to prevent it um in some way right but we don't have to get into the technical details but just understand that if this is a way for you to remove yourself one degree from the case uh to protect yourself if you're able to do it um successfully Yeah So that being said what I did was you know so I had to answer to these claims uh with defenses Okay So um now let me just preface this by saying first that like you Brandon I didn't know much about the actual court procedure like what paperwork do you have to file that thing like the affidavit of service I didn't know about I knew there was service but I didn't know that there was that kind of a document that needed to be filed Right So what I did as soon as I got served with the papers there is that there were some different phone numbers there on there for the local uh county courthouse and I just called them up and I said how can I you know get some help with the procedures Now you of course they're not going to tell you about legal strategies in the law like we're talking about tonight but they sent me to the law library for the county And I called them up and they said "Oh you let's make you an appointment." I went in there There were three librarians They weren't busy that day I guess that sat down with me And they had already prepared uh actually and they handed me like templates for uh different responses that I could follow one template or the other They asked me about if I was using any affirmative defenses They gave me a document about affirmative defenses right they told they asked me about counter claims right they were super helpful Um you know and they told me exactly what papers to file and such They even told me stuff that I didn't even technically have to do right and they answered all my questions and I'm going to you know continue to go back and get further information from them as the case goes on They're an excellent resource It's almost like they're your free parallegals Uh I mean they're not going to fill out documents for you but you know you say "Oh could you find some information on this?" They'll go find it and then and then give it to you So and they they really like you know doing this especially if you're someone who you know is an nice generally speaking and not an I'm just laughing because I'm just thinking in the back of my head a little plug for um for any lonely men out there who may have some failures with online dating Go meet your local librarian They want to get some get some feminine energy in your life You know what I'm saying there was only one one man in the library They were all women That's There you go See see there you go We got you We got you here you know Yes Brandon You know this is what this is your the male demographic right you always have to look for that angle Yep Yep Yep So um so what I did is because you know what I'm saying really right they're saying I violated the contract by not paying but I did right i sent in lots of paperwork actually way more than you would if you just sent a check each month Um because what I did was you know I sent the instrument right that bill of exchange we were talking about with a cover letter with instructions And the first time I did this I also sent a power of attorney And then when they didn't respond I sent them a notice of dishonor right because um non-payment is dishonor and I you know they're they're part involved in paying um actually right so they're eligible for dishonor and that's in UCCC article 3 as well and and in after several months of this I actually went to the um length of filing a formal protest which is also known as a certificate of dishonor where a notary actually reviews the evidence that they I sent them these uh instruments in good faith And I then sent them a notice of dishonor and they still didn't respond Um and so that they are now officially in dishonor adjudicated by a notary And this is part of your notorial protest duties which is required in every state's uh notary laws And then I sent a copy of that to the secretary of state who is the boss of all the notaries for your state They're like the head notary So that that's a a legal document right that's admissible as evidence Um so so I actually right sent them quite a lot of correspondence and it includes my you know noticing them that they're not actually doing what they're supposed to do right which is a type of dispute So instead of a normal defense right where you where you kind of say well yes I did that but here's how why it's justified right um so for example if I called them up and said hey I'm going to be you know on a expedition to Antarctica for the next 6 months and I won't be able to pay my bills Uh can you please send me a bill when I get back and then they sue you while you're gone saying you didn't pay your bills right i could defend that saying "Hey we had an agreement that I was going to be out of the country right?" But in this case I'm I actually did send in payments So I would use what's called an affirmative defense basically saying "I I actually did that but you guys are cheating in some way right?" And and the um what I chose to use to help with that is fraud Okay so essentially they're committing fraud by stating that there's this debt that I owe to them when in fact I have more than adequately fulfilled my performance obligation to satisfy that debt And it gets even it gets even more exciting than that too just to chime in for two seconds Um please every time you use your credit card uh you are promising to pay It says right on the receipt that prints out every single time every single credit transaction If you think about if you want to go even crazier see it's it's so unrealistic to people Everything is money You are surrounded by money I I I I was on my group the other day and I said I said to somebody I said "You are scuba Steve You really are scuba Steve." Because you got to think about this Every time you use your debit card you are in that transaction A debit card is essentially the same as an eche A debit card transaction is an unconditional order to move funds Right a credit card transaction is an unconditional promise to pay funds Right so what's crazy is that every single transaction that you're doing there's some sort of negotiable instrument that's either being manufactured or being transferred or being used in order to create that transaction That's right So you you you are the author of money and you are drowning in money There is so much money in your life Every single bill that you get is a positive number Every single bill can be converted All that positive value can be used Uh uh every single credit card transaction every single time you use your credit card you're producing a promise to pay When you sign that promise to pay and let's if I'd like to because this can be a little confusing I want to break down the credit card transactions so that so that anyone who's listening to this you can go look at these documents and see exactly how this flows So I'm going to step right over here for just a moment get a drink and I'm going to I'm going to be listening the whole time Okay All right Great So I'll just I'll take the empty uh space off camera and talk about this for a minute So first you have your your card member agreement right which is your contract with the bank who's uh owns the account uh of your credit card Now in all these card members agreements you'll find a section called promise to pay And this is where it essentially states that you know I promise to pay all uh charges for all transactions for goods services etc It might be worded slightly differently um in each card member agreement Okay so you sign and execute that card member agreement in order to actually receive the card and begin using the account Now what happens when you make a credit card purchase okay Now you if you remember back in the day you always had to s physically sign a piece of paper when you use your credit card for a purchase Now they have various electronics in the card that actually provides your signature uh electronically for you and you you actually agreed to that in the card members agreement as well And but if you you can still sign these receipts and sometimes you might have the occasion So just take a look at what it actually says Now occasionally it does use the word promise but most commonly because I've studied these over the past uh months it says "I authorize this uh charge or this transaction." And and many times it references the card member agreement in the language below the signature line And so what this is is it's referencing the promise to pay section So it doesn't have to use the word promise on the document because it's on the master uh promisory agreement right which is that card member agreement is really a master promisory note And then each of these receipts is an is the uh actual promisory note with the amount on it right because the card member agreement has no amount And for a promisory note to be valid it has to have um a an amount of uh money that's promised to be paid including interest right and so that's on these little receipts So those are your promisory notes So what happens is um when those get back to the bank we want to know how the funds actually move around Right now most people think what happens is is that the bank in their account right has a big fund and that each time you do a credit card charge they take money out of that fund and pay the merchant um where you're shopping or you know the restaurant where you just had dinner But that's not how it works at all Um and how it works is um written about in the Federal Reserve Act section 16 um and look at the first two uh paragraphs of that section of the law So Brandon I was just kind of told them the whole thing about the promise Oh okay Great Now if you look in um paragraph 2 we'll just focus there uh for a second right it says that any member bank uh that's a member of the Federal Reserve but I believe that banks who aren't members actually have work with member banks to do this for them I believe personally that the all cap's name is a member bank but that's a theory Anyway well that that's interesting And I even heard someone say that the all cap's name is a on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve Well think about this Think about this and and and and I I don't want to lose the audience but gosh I love this conversation Uh think about this If if if if your your all capital letter name is producing currency all the time every time you use a credit transaction every time you place that credit card in that machine or or tap it on a machine or tap it on a gas station you're producing a brand new currency out of thin air Didn't exist a second ago and now it does It's called a promisary note Uh if if you're if you're in legis which is the Latin term for the the legal fiction all caps name straight out of the dictionary Um if your if your N's legis is not a bank how is that currency being produced it has to be a bank Otherwise this is like this is like massively massively illegal And if you look inside of a lot of the definitions of bank or banking or banker a lot of it has to do with credit transactions creating credit transactions being involved in credit transactions almost every definition of bank or banking or banker I've ever seen if the ensle is it's almost like it's the chicken or the egg too It's kind of like well hold on was it a bank and that's why it can produce currency or because it's producing currency it is a bank but I'm telling you it's one or the other it has to be by process elimination there's no there is no there's nothing to even talk about there's no argument there there can't be an argument yeah I mean you know Brandon if you look in UCC I think it's um article 9 uh it gives the definition of a bank right which is a person doing banking exactly right and No that's what I So people always think was it a bank was it a bank before you put the credit card in the in the credit card machine or was it a bank you know what I mean but I'm telling you it's it's one of it was either a bank before and that's why it produces or because it produces it is now It's one or the other It has to be It has to be There's no So what what Brandon is talking about here is as I was about to get to in that Federal Reserve Act right what the bank can do is that they can go to the Federal Reserve right they sometimes call this the Federal Reserve window um or their Federal Reserve agent that represents that bank from their regional Federal Reserve And they basically apply to the Federal Reserve to get Federal Reserve notes And they with the application they have to submit essentially a whole list of things but they're really negotiable instruments So it's a uh you know a bill a draft a promise a note a bill u a all the same stuff Y right All those things an unconditional order to pay or an unconditional promise to pay It's always it's there's a bunch of different things but all those various things fit into one of those two categories Always That's right It's just one of those two and and it's so confusing when you say all the different things So I I'm starting to kind of go more towards teaching it just it's either an unconditional promise to pay or an unconditional order to pay and all those things and all the things they list and all these crazy banking terms and it either fits into one or or the other every single time You know what I mean that's right And um essentially you know it could be a draft or a note whatever it is any of those instruments that they basically can take that instrument and trade it in for the exact amount of Federal Reserve notes as is on that instrument And that instrument gets its power from our signatures right as agent for our principles And so the the bank is actually using the note right that you signed right and they're cashing that in and then giving you back your own money and then asking you to pay them that amount a second time It's it's like madness on top of madness on top of it's just like three or four layers of complete madness And and it's when you when you start to in my own opinion I'm starting to get a lot of clarity in the litigation right because the litigation is is literally this simple for every single financial transaction from what I can tell so far is when you understand how all this works it's very easy to develop some questions in your mind that you may have some curiosity as to what the hell happened right all you do is you you write up a complaint which is pretty simple You can look up a YouTube video on that I will be producing a lot of material on this by the way You wait for the other party to answer the complaint and then you immediately motion the court which means you you you write up an order to move the court That's how the court system works is it's like a football field You're trying to get down the football field to the various uh yard lines And you're going to go into what's called discovery Now once you go into discovery you can start asking these questions Now they they these questions when you actually understand how all this stuff works these questions make them very uncomfortable and the more questions that you ask just literally you're just like I mean I don't even recommend that you go online and find my questions What I want to do is I'm going to be teaching people how to really be curious about this and how to develop their own questions because when you when you're really curious and you really have questions what happened in my original promisary note what did you guys do when was it taken to the Federal Reserve subpoena the Federal Reserve Get them to to prove you guys swapped this When did you swap it let me see the papers I want to see it By that point they are sweating man They are sweating and they are running right so so when you when you when you understand all of this that's why we said earlier this stuff never goes to trial because if you get into discovery all you're going to do is just like a kid in a candy store uh like asking dad "Daddy daddy what's um what's this?" And daddy daddy what's this what's this daddy Daddy What's That's it That's all you have to do Literally And and and you will win I've never heard of anyone doing that Not winning ever Ever And And I've seen so many examples where they do a very poor job of it The questions are poor The the the sentences are poor The grammar is poor Everything is poor They don't really have a good grasp but they kind of sort of in the dark go in this direction and do this and they they win every single time They settle immediately They don't want just please make it stop You know what I mean that's that's kind of their reaction So what's so fascinating about this conversation is it's it's kind of a lot farther than than what anyone's really talking about right now in this space Um you you you're not going to find hardly anyone talking about this anywhere That's right We're we're breaking ground And yeah it's big time what you just described in the way to ask questions you know that's kind of like the country lawyer tactic Yeah Where you you basically like you know pretend that you're totally ignorant about what's going on and you're you know like you're a member of the jury so to speak right yes And or a country bumpkin and just say "Well okay So I come into the bank and I fill out an application for a loan right what do you do with that application?" and just take it very slow like that right and it's very you know every single step you want to know And that that's how you're going to get to the bottom of this And I also want to you know talk about well what evidence do you request because I I showed this to you uh in private Brandon but in a separate matter uh related to a uh a mortgage e um I asked for a bookkeeping entry that shows the I well what I specifically asked for was show that the loan funds were a pre-existing asset of the bank and then demonstrate that those loan funds were transferred into my account Uh right giving me the loan Now um they they couldn't do either but they did send me the bookkeeping entry showing the the loan from their account from the bank's general uh fund uh they called it I think And this was fascinating because there were not one but there were two entries right there was a deposit and a withdrawal a credit and a debit an asset and a liability simultaneously And what this was right was this was they took my promisory note went to the Federal Reserve window or you can you can also exchange it at the treasury in different ways But they did this They got the funds right that were generated by my signature on the note I essentially gave them an instrument worth that much uh funds So they got that that that's the deposit that went into their account Then they took those funds and they transferred them out Now they didn't put them in my account They gave them to a third party actually which I didn't authorize but that's kind of a separate matter for that case But here right the the exact evidence So I could go and say hey how could you give me a loan if you have no net liability on your books you you're neutral right and then that would violate the actual fabric of a contract itself which states that there has to be equal consideration to have a contract Yeah exactly There's a lot there's a lot here We're kind of we're kind of uh I have a feeling we're kind of killing off your audience here but it's good I mean this is this is all this is all so true And for people who there's a lot of really advanced stuff that we're talking about Um and I and I and I just want to I think that a lot of people might be kind of lost or kind of in and out on this one Uh but but it just kind of is what it is Uh you know we can definitely have additional conversations on this but this is uh there's a lot of there's a lot of this is going to be probably better for my audience to be honest with you Well uh my audience is going to go ballistic over this one Uh so Brandon let's simplify it because I we're really talking about two two aspects here right one is we're saying right there is no real money Yes So we're going to use the paper that you send us and try to figure out the proper way to work within this system right and we're honoring that the way that you're obligated to do Yeah In 1933 they took away the gold and silver coins which the Constitution says is the only way to pay In exchange they gave us all infinite credit Nowadays circa 2024 quote infinite credit end quote or US dollars quote end quote are defined as two things They're defined as an unconditional order to pay or an unconditional promise to pay Both of those things are called negotiable instruments The word instrument means document or contract The word negotiable means transferable That's basically literally the entire the entire thing in a nutshell It's so simple when you explain that way that it's people are like it can't be that this can't be They there's a lot of emotional rejection seriously and and I went through it you know and everyone goes through it and it's okay I understand that That's that's the most difficult part of all of this now I feel like cuz when I explain it to people I know I'm on the right track when what I get back is a completely emotional response I'm like "Okay good That's good." because that means the information the factual information was understood and it triggered an emotional defensive response Right so it's like am I getting a a a a negative reaction on the information side or am I getting a negative reaction on the emotional side right now the emotional side that rejection can be overcome by grounding the information and letting them know how does this benefit you Once they understand once once a person understands the benefits then what happens is they allow the emotional blockage to release because the thing is is that the emotional blockage is there because of I've been this dumb for this long I've been wrong my whole life I've been working so hard for these stupid  things and now I'm just an idiot But but once you can once you say no no don't worry about all that Everyone's in the same boat Don't worry about all that It's all fine You're fine this is the benefit that's going to happen to your life if you if you just drop those emotional barriers and move forward and try to understand this stuff and move forward into trying to do this stuff To me that's been the most successful avenue And I'm able to get people just over the over the factual bar uh and then over the emotional bar like that right and that's how I do it I do it by by grounding the information and saying this is what you can do with this information for example every bill every promisary note everything You can go out and buy a car right now taking the information from this video that we've explained so far which is a little bit convoluted a little bit all over the place but it's okay It's our first time talking together And and and you by the way by the way for my audience I I don't think I've ever seen documentation as well as I've seen Dr Kaufman's information I mean it's it's the the the the the complaint that you sent me was I mean 10 stars I mean just just and and it's 10 stars just objectively like subjectively in relation to everything else I see It's a it's a trillion stars But but just taking all that out out and just just just just non-relative just straight up like it's 10 stars It's 10 star It's so far beyond anything that no one is going to be able to comprehend what you've written It's it's just way too far above the anybody that you're going to come in contact with It's so and and that's and that's the problem that I have is that I I I I'll show you my complaint later privately Mine is like dumb Mine is like like kindergarten It's like it's like so so the way a complaint is written we can get back into this a little bit if you don't mind The way the way a complaint is written is very very simple People think and I thought too this is what I thought when I first when when your first document when you first file I thought it had to have everything in the kitchen sink You got to have you got to collect it all together It's got to be a book It's got to be you know it's not like that at all because the the word allege so so a complaint that first document you're going to file in a lawsuit is called allegations Now the definition of allege or allegation is the key to everything It's it's setting forth that of which the person intends to prove You're not proving it right now What you're doing is you're saying I have evidence over here this is all the stuff that I intend on proving and then you send that and they have to answer that and then you start to bring in the evidence and you start to prove everything and that's that this is the way that the court system so you can get these things rolling like boom boom you can do a complaint and you can send it in and then you're already over here organizing your evidence you're not even done with that yet you're just like you're just like boom it's out they have to okay and now you're over here getting your evidence together so it can go fast I thought I thought at first I had to have the whole planet in order I thought I had to align all the stars before I could file a complaint Right so and my complaint is very simple My complaint is like we had a contract Uh uh some of the items in this particular interaction are negotiable instruments Negotiable instruments are defined as blank This document was uh this document is an unconditional promise to pay This document was written This document was signed Next document This document is an unconditional order to pay This document next line This document was signed Next line This document was written Literally That's the way my complaint is It's like this is what a this is can we agree this is what the definition of of a promisary note is and it has three different elements And then I say "Okay this document has this element this element and this element." And that's the whole complaint all the way down the entire complaint That's all it is There's really nothing else in it I made it so dumb that it was like a 5-year-old could look at it and be like "You're screwed man There's no way around this one." You know no Listen you know right brevity is the soul of wit So if you can use concision uh to craft your document it it's definitely going to be helpful And the you know the reason why you can't you couldn't possibly make all your arguments in the complaint because you're going to obtain evidence through the course of discovery and it's you don't know what you can prove right so what you want to do is add things that you think you you're not sure you could prove but you might be able to because later on if you don't prove them they just get dropped But if you don't mention it there is they won't let you bring new uh arguments on at some point or new causes of action right so but you could just put them in a list You don't need to give all the reasoning Uh just very very bare bones So even this complaint right that was served to me Um it's only two pages Yeah It's and and I think there's an exhibit attached This is a lot of the information that I like to and this is all the information that's going to go into the my my pro living course because I I I I'm trying to break the illusionary spell that litigation is akin to climbing Mount Everest with with no rations and no friends by yourself which is which is pretty much what people think it is including myself I thought that as well Um and it's not even it's it's like it's like it's like stepping on an antill Uh but but it all comes down to perception Perception is reality obviously right so so so I like to talk about things and to give information that breaks that illusionary reality And the and the illusionary the the the true piece of information is you can just I mean kind of slap this thing together Uh as long as you believe you can put together coherent information in the next 30 to 60 days you can just kind of slap this thing together I mean you could you could just type up something in five freaking minutes and send it into the court Now Brandon this th this um complaint and summons that you filed was it for a similar situation where you um paid with negotiable instruments or a conditional acceptance or No no this one is this one is pretty wild So so it's a it's a real estate deal where there's all these these purchase agreements and there's all these and I'm claiming all of them as negotiable instruments and I'm rescending all of the blank negotiation on all of them and I'm forcing a a a realy company to convert all of them at the Federal Reserve window into Federal Reserve notes and deposit them into an escrow account So I I I I'm going like a pretty high Yeah you're Yeah you're you're going for the gold right away I'm going for the I I you know I this thing fell on my plate It's a client of mine uh at the at the I have a law firm at a law office It's it's it's something that kind of fell in my lap Uh the the lawyers on the defense side kind of pissed me off and and the the the client was just you know ready to go very level-headed uh very well educated and I just said you know what f it I'm going for it and and I just that's this is our first lawsuit you know Uh it's okay It is it is a bit complicated but it's okay I am I feel I feel 100% ready for it If if not actually I feel like I've I've not not regrettably but I feel like I I've been a little bit pussyfooted I I've been I I should have done this a while ago Not not on a regret form but I I'm ready I feel super ready for this so I'm going for it Well look it I don't think it's ever a bad idea um to delay things and do a little bit more preparation especially for the people we're talking to here right like for example if this is you know and I I was assuming that most of the people who would view this already know a lot of this and maybe have even done some of these processes to pay bills but have never gone to court But don't start sending paperwork to creditors until you understand what you're doing Oh yes I say that all the time So if you've done it already you should know understand what we are talking about in terms of the uh the legal arguments Even though the the stuff that we're talking about about litigation you know is a different matter I the the way I look at it just real quick on that because I think this is such an important thing to talk about Um my my personal communication on this is you're I'm I'm I have never been 100% when I take action I've been like 80 to 85% confident And I feel like it's just a ratio You know what I mean like like for me 80 to 85% I know that I'm going to unlock that remaining 20% when I when I take action So it's like I hit 80% logically and then emotionally I know that the remaining 20% I need to move forward to get the the remaining 20% Right and I think there's a lot of people who they're they're at 20% and they take action and then they crash and burn and they splatter all over the street and then you have the 100% people who never ever take action because they're waiting for something that will never happen So I think for every single individual there's a there's a ri there there's some middle ground there's a ratio where where where the the logical information is at a peak point It's the emotional understanding that that I feel like you're not you're just simply not going to hit that until you force yourself to move through the wall of fire and and and do what needs to be done And that that it's the emotional side that will correct and clarify as you gain that confidence through action And for me that that ratio is around 80 or 85% So I think in my head am I am I 80% If I am I just take action It's like a policy for me I just take action at around 80% Period If I'm not 80% I don't I just don't It's like I It's like a a completely unthinking totally logical uh uh flag in the ground It's like no matter what if I'm below 80 I'm like nah If I'm above 80 it's action time Period That's how I do it And you know you could say a threshold would be just if you can explain it to another individual who's unfamiliar with this area of the law right and get them to understand it then you definitely know it well enough to do the process That's a good point That's very well enough to you know you may brush up on it to go into court right but uh but that that's I I think a good standard Like you you did that show with uh the gentleman who uh was successful uh with a credit card Um and that's what happened to him since right but he was that was a dice roll and we we got a we got a six You know what I mean we hit the you know that was But yes so he he was a great example because right he definitely knew the material well enough to write his own very simple instruction letter right and um I I think we were both impressed by the how um to the point that was right it was like one sentence and enough to get the job done Even when they called him it was like a two-minute phone call and and his instructions was like one sentence Yeah I think I think that definitely contributed to because because in in this space everyone's sending letters to the chief financial officer or the indentured trustee or this person that person or God or who else This dude just sends it into the billing department which is like unheard of You know I've sent everything to the billing department Um but I've sent it to multiple parties Yeah he just did the building department Well he actually he made up a department remember he he put something like remittance department but they didn't have one like but he just put that on the envelope and remember address from the normal billing thing Yeah So but but you know like if you're able to do that like you you don't need to follow a template You can write your own cover letter right even if it's not perfect I'd say that's also a good bar right and we should and and it's it's good to have other people's templates especially when they're good because we can't always think of everything right and we might uh look at that and say "Oh I want to I want to you know utilize that phrase or that sentence but but we shouldn't be just copying everything word for word and using everything like that right we need to if we understand this we can write it Or we might get a template from someone else and say you know what I'm not sure this part's correct I'm going to I'm going to look it up and I'm going to correct it Right and because you can't you can never guarantee that what anyone else has done is going to be successful is accurate right unless you have checked everything yourself or you know you've you've created it yourself So it's very tempting to like see the the potential here and just grab something and run with it but that's where you're going to later on have a moment uh of uh fear and regret most likely So just understand it at a basic level of competency that you could talk about it that you could write a simple and we're talking about less than a one-page letter here Uh so this is not like uh Brandon's you know 24page document that he sent to American Express We don't you we don't it was all part I'm not I'm I laugh a little bit in in slight embarrassment I guess but it's it's just all part of the learning process for me Uh you know I'm not really embarrassed I just I just look back and it's just it's just kind of humorous in my opinion But yeah Yeah Yeah You don't need to you don't need to you don't need to write a short story Uh you don't need to write a micro novel which I did Uh seriously But you know what what we really have here right in this system is just it's all it is is is paper moving around right you sign a paper you give it to the bank they give it to another bank that they give them paper back they give you different paper right and and all of that paper the value that we perceive you know it's really ironic because we feel that you know we have to go out and and give our time and our energy and our work right to get those notes notes uh in order to live But we never stop and say you know where do those notes really come from right we might assume that they're backed by gold or that you know some bank just has the authority to at will print them and create them but it's actually us We are the ones who create all that value right it all comes from us signing one of those pieces of paper Then that paper becomes the value and they can just trade it for any form that they want They could trade it for another promisory note They could trade it for a check or a draft They could trade it for Federal Reserve notes They could trade it for securities like ownership securities right stocks bonds and all of these things go on right but the the one source of all of that right comes from us and the energy from our signature So really you know and I know this is a is a tall order to accept right but we have been cheated Now it doesn't mean you shouldn't work right because we have to be productive um in our life and even to fulfill the duties of generating this paper it still is work right we have to if we do it really responsibly we have to do accounting for it right we have to answer all notices and um uh communicate that information appropriately and such and that is our labor right and for the fruits of that we're entitled to live with the benefits um so I'm not saying that you should resent that you have been productive in your life It's just that you didn't realize the value that you bring to the table And so now you can take this information and change the equation So that you right because we're all meant to live in abundance It's just that we have been treated as children and children get allowances They can't be trusted to have all the resources right they have trust funds for rich kids so they don't go and blow all all the money right because it's supposed to last the rest of their life And we are essentially have all been in this system been treated like children that we cannot be trusted So we're given these allowances and we're told to do the chores right which is our nine-to-five jobs But so once we understand this and come out of it and rise up to be competent adults well now we can take the responsibility to manage the resources ourselves And that means that we get access to the full resources which as you say are practically infinite Yeah I mean I say infinite money on all my stuff just because that's literally like a video game term I'm not I'm not kidding That's why I that's why I say it That's exactly why I say it It's it's just a you know but it is it is really the real life monopoly right because we have that right there are the rules right that we we can't in our incompetent state we can't exchange our promisory notes directly for Federal Reserve notes right we need to go and beg the banker to you know do it for us because they're our trustee in that matter or our fiduciary and that means they have certain responsibilities to us right but we can't do it on our own in these rules until we demonstrate competency and then perhaps if we ask we'll actually be given access to do it directly ourselves Yeah Yeah It's a whole it's a whole experience of self-discovery and uh you know it's a people want to go to school for you know four five 6 7 8 years and then come out and then build a career which takes several years Uh this is basically kind of the same idea but it's it's it's compounded into maybe two years Uh it's it's basically your 2-year school all the way through career building option that costs nothing upfront and it takes about two years I'd say at this point in time which is a lot less than it ever has been because of all the resources available Uh we've never ever I would say two years if you really do it full-time during those two years Oh yeah of course I I mean if you but but I'm saying if you were to focus on it as much as you'd focus on let's say a college degree right or I I would say more like a master's degree or even law school because you know law school is three years right and and they don't even touch on this material Yeah So so something like along that same idea is what it's going to take to get yourself into a position where uh everything is money Literally everything is money I'm not even kidding Um you create money with your fingertips Your pens create money Everything anyone sends you is money Uh that's basically the life that I live Um and the problem is is getting anyone else to realize that everything is money and that I'm sending money and that I'm creating money That's the part that I'm having a hard time with and that's the part where litigation comes in And that's why I'm learning litigation essentially That's right Because you know even if you now because I've done quite a bit of this since I've learned this law is that I've looked at financial pundits and experts that and not and I don't even go to you know CNN or Fox News or the Wall Street Journal I'm looking in more in the alternative financial um you know gurus who have large platforms you know on the usual places like YouTube and they give quite you know detailed commentary but you can find a lot of them talking about how the banking system and finance works and you know they have these uh there's sort of like the lay um understanding which is you know that the banks actually have their own money and they lend it to you and you pay them back right and everybody Everybody in banking knows that's not what's going on But what they think is that it's all about fractional reserve lending and that the banks have money but they only but they can lend out way more than they have Right but that's but that's not wrong either And there are very very few You can find one or two of them in interviews here and there that will actually explain how the banking system like what we're talking about today what I what we talked about before about how they just create the money based on our our promisory note when we apply for a loan right so there are but because only a few even elite bankers really understand this or at least they're willing to talk about it on an interview right that's why it's an uphill battle but if we you know like in my uh lawsuit for example right if if if it goes to discovery where I get to um depose owes people on their side right because the the chief financial officer for the bank is a party to the lawsuit because I sent the bills to that individual So that means I could if necessary subpoena that individual to come or me go to them for a deposition um to answer questions in this case because there's a part they're in the party in the case and they sued me So of course I have the right to cross-examine my accuser now which is their literal Well I'm sure I want to say worst nightmare I want to say worst nightmare but but I frankly with the amount of research I've done so far I I'm not even sure what the CFO knows Well it it doesn't matter because one thing is you know the CFO of one of the major banks in the United States to have to sit and spend hours giving testimony for a $5,000 lawsuit like I Oh no no no That's never I don't think the company will will let that fly in the first place right yeah But getting beyond that like even if he doesn't know then he would have to claim ignorance about the basic the very basic mechanics of banking which he's in charge of all of the financial operations So that would make him look quite bad and then I would be able to say okay well who in your company does know the answer to these questions so that I could depose them or do you have you know written policies that discuss this who's your you know Federal Reserve agent that you deal with yeah These are by the way these are questions These are these are qu you're you what what what you just said right there That's the most deadly I mean that is just I mean you're they they would rather have you take a knife and jam it in their chest They would ra they they they had to choose between a knife in the chest and those questions you just asked Give me the knife Give me if it's a full if it's a full metal jacket 9 millimeter round it's probably going to be less painful than the questions that Dr Kaufman just asked So give me give me the 9 millm round of the chest These are hollow point questions Yeah Yeah Um you know they're they're really uh these are 300 win mag questions Yes they really are They really are And when you realize that this is it's just that simple man you start getting the right questions and you curious you know there's a a case I believe it was in Minnesota and it was a jury trial um and but the judge was a justice of the peace and later this case was vacated by the state supreme court and but you can still find it um you know I I forget the name of it but basically what happened is that this whole thing was exposed that it was a a lawyer who defaulted on his mortgage and there was was a foreclosure uh proceeding And at trial this lawyer put the president of the bank up on the stand and basically got him to answer all these questions uh that I just described um about you know that that he never got a loan And the jury unanimously um ruled you know in favor of this guy who was being foreclosed upon right and but you could tell from reading about this case that the everyone was so afraid of this ruling uh being upheld that they found some technicality to overrule it and get rid of it So it could never be used um as case law for another case It can only be sort of talked about right but but you see the effect that it had on the jury because as soon as a jury of your peers right and I I'm going to definitely demand that this be a jury trial right most of these cases would not They would be just have the judge decide but no no no I mean I want the jury to be able to find out how the banking system is fraud right so they would if I was able to get this testimony and you know have this trial play out it would be in the public record right that means I could call up you know all the news media the next day and say "Hey you know what the the CFO of you know the largest one of the largest banks in the nation said at trial here's the transcript." You know Right I mean it's on the record It's not I'm you know I didn't make anything up They can quote it directly right and that'll be a juicy story that somebody is going to pick up Maybe it'll be a local news channel because you know the the bigger ones may be uh told not to report on that right but but they don't want to take a chance And so if I if I can demonstrate that I can ask the right questions and and elicit this information and also ask for the evidentiary record like that bookkeeping entry for example which could also be called an audit trail um and correlate those things It's like they they would be taking such a huge public relations risk right because you know what if they if it comes out in court right that they don't lend anybody any money Yeah What do you think all the other card holders are going to do i'm not paying them anymore Yeah Exactly You know not the normal way anymore Yeah Yeah So so they would you know I think most likely want to settle with me But but I actually have a little strategy in place as a fail safe for that because let's say that they sue me and I write a response and it's really strong and they look at it and they they realize oh we didn't really want to put all this work in for a $5,000 you know debt so we'll just dismiss the case We'll drop it We'll let him off the hook Well they can't do that with me because I filed counter claims Yeah So right a counter claim means you know not only are you suing me and it's it's not really uh the merits aren't there but actually you're in the wrong and I'm going to counter sue you right so now they can't they can't dismiss it because they have to answer to those counter claims right so the only way they could get out of it is by negotiating and offering me something to dismiss the counter claims Exactly That's that's one thing I've been talking about from my people Yeah It's always it's so important You always want to go on the offensive as quickly as possible If you that's what I've been talking about to all my people in the past week or two If you're ever sued you want to get a counter claim in immediately Everyone everyone in this space of legal and law and and negotiable instruments and all this stuff that we're talking about my whole platform everybody on it everybody in every single group is so worried about defense defense defense defense I'm being sued I'm being sued I got pulled over You everyone needs to understand that you want to turn you being the defendant into you being the plaintiff as rapidly as possible and you want to go on the offensive and you want to counterattack as rapidly as possible if you can be the first one to attack and you can be the plaintiff before you are the defendant it's always better You you always want to and the thing is when you realize how much fraud is here and every single one of these things all this stuff is so rife with fraud you can turn around and come at them with 10 time a million times as much ammunition and power and you should instantly If anything if anything most people I recommend you you try to become the plaintiff before they sue you Even if if they threaten to sue you you sue them first If not then you do a counter claim immediately You go straight on the offensive You're going straight at their throat The moment you get the the the complaint you're going straight at their throat So this is where the law librarians really helped me out because I thought that I would have to file a motion separately for counter claims but they told me according to the procedures I can actually include them in my response to the lawsuit So this is very convenient and it's the first document I filed right so it is from the get-go Perfect Like you talked about and then that puts them in the hot seat Yeah So I thought it might be helpful just to to list off the counter claims that I made because I think these are relevant even if you're if you're filing the suit right because they they mess things up in a number of ways Now the first one was frivolous litigation because now that you can only file as a defendant right but basically I said that that they their their claim is based on evidence that's not factual because they say there is no payment when there is a payment Right so frivolous litigation and what that allows you to do is ask for damages um damages for your your fees In other words if you paid a lawyer or for your own time uh that you can get in that case as a defendant Uh and they by the way they asked for court costs um in their initial complaint So they want to sue me and they want me to pay for the expense of suing me So I'm saying you sued me frivolously um based on things that are not factual and so you actually have to pay my court costs Now the other three that I filed could be causes of action in your complaint um as a plaintiff And so obviously we've been talking a lot about breach of contract and the fraud that you mentioned is is part of that right because they misrepresented themsel fraudulently in in the contract and then they did not fulfill their obligations of accepting payment uh for the contract Um then there's a breach of fiduciary duty because when you um negotiate or endorse a negotiable instrument um and then you deliver it to the responsible party they have a fiduciary duty to you based on that instrument if you have a certain status on the instrument which is known as the holder or the holder in due course So now this is where you have to learn uh some more about negotiable instruments but essentially they sent it to you for you to do something with and that makes you the holder or like kind of like the owner of that instrument and then when you send it to them and say here do this with the instrument you know and you've done it according to the law they have a duty to you to carry that out a fiduciary duty and if they don't do that they violate it So and the beauty the beauty of what Dr Dr Coppin just said too by the way is that's the actual legal definition of the word payment The actual legal definition of the word payment is performance Payment and performance mean the same thing So when they send you this paper you're supposed to do something with the paper You do something with the paper and you send it back That that action of doing something with the paper and sending it back legally is defined as a payment And it's actually legally defined as a payment for US dollars And that's the part that no like literally I've talked to massive private banking professionals and there's even a guy here who lives in my building who who is at Chase Bank over here and he even told me he's like "Yeah I've been hearing about some of this stuff I didn't know you did this." Like I'm actually very curious in some of this stuff because it's just like we never taught any of this stuff in the banking And I said "Oh come over man I'll teach you everything." I sent him some videos and stuff So yeah it's it's it's it's it all So so so what banking is just just to clear this up because I think this is also really important to talk about just really really quick Banking is a whole bunch a massive humongous cloud of completely unnecessary complexity that was developed on purpose so that no one would understand it Okay But in real honest to god truth it's it's just a few pieces of information Like that's it It's l just they give you paper you sign the paper in a certain way you give it back and and that's it You're done Literally like if you want to go to the ultimate simplicity as to how it really works That's how it really works Uh and and and you think "Oh it's all so complicated Oh it's also this." When you start to realize this whole thing you start to go down this rabbit hole You you see all this this this information like this right and then you start to dig and dig and dig and you just you're like "Oh this is junk You throw this out All this is junk you throw this out This is junk Junk junk junk junk junk junk junk." And you wind up with just a bunch of dumpsters and all that's left is just like a few pieces of information That's it And that's the beauty of it because it's it's it's designed that way on purpose so that no one can understand it That's the only defense they have Yes And they they of course you know create lots of uh terms that are redundant And um the way that they write the language in the law is often you know they'll have you know several clauses um and then connecting a subject and a predicate you know with uh four commas in between right so it's tricky You have to kind of learn the technique and you have to sit there always with the law dictionary Um because even simple words like here I'll give you one You probably know this already but the word at in a law dictionary means near So like for example attorney at law means an attorney near the law as opposed to like an attorney in fact right which means that they are the fact attorney right um so this is uh you know really important You would easily miss something like that And that's how we know that payment actually means performance It doesn't mean handing Federal Reserve notes to someone and it doesn't mean handing gold to someone Yeah Right It means performing Yeah So so performance So so people think they have to go out and work to get Federal Reserve notes and then pay with Federal Reserve notes to discharge quote debt But but what we're learning and the the secondary option and the in my opinion preferable option is to simply perform when you perform uh you don't need Federal Reserve notes and your debts are paid The problem is that no one knows that Even the bank doesn't know that Well that someone and that's the issue Someone at the bank knows it But this is this is where this movement is currently located This currently this this movement is currently located at We know how this all works We've got it all down We deliver what we need to do We perform But they say we haven't performed They say it's not a payment They say it's not US dollars and that and and you get on the phone with them and they think you're crazy So what other options do we have we have litigation I mean look and I always tell everybody the same thing If you have a better idea I'm all ears because I don't know of anything better than than I don't know of any other option we have except litigation Litigation is you are forced to sit down and have a conversation with me about how this really works And if I prove that it really does work this way which is very easy by the way then you're going to now accept my performance that you didn't accept before and you're going to pay me for wasting my time That's what litigation is And and that's by the way all these things right you can simply in your interrogatory ask the other side you know what what is your definition of payment bro I'll tell you I'll tell you I'll tell I'll tell you guys I'll tell the audience Let's say there was a a a lawsuit for $50 million and I had to choose between the $50 million or just getting my questions answered the $50 million bro You can keep it I don't even want it Don't even show it to me It's like asking for a wish to have Bro I want the questions answered I'll pay Keep You know what hookers and blow Go take the 50 million Do whatever you want Send me photos of how much fun you have with the 50 million I want answers to these questions because answers to these questions are are are make the 50 million look like a ham sandwich from Costco Literally that's how I think of this information because dude if you if I find out how the Federal Reserve window works who's this who's the person who who does the swab do they know how this works i want to see the forms that are submitted I want to see the endorsements that are submitted Why are they submitted that way blah blah blah You can literally print your own money forever When you realize how this really works and you get down to the actual facts and you start to ask these kind of questions it's infinite money for real And it's infinite money from like three different sources You can swap You can do credit card swap You can do you got infinite money literally all around you You can go on private jets You can buy 10 private jets 10 mansions I could buy 15 I could buy the whole Hollywood Hills All of it So 50 million I don't want 50 million Don't even That's disgusting Don't even show that to me I want the information because if you get the information I'll drop the whole lawsuit bro You just give me the information I'll drop everything I'll cut you loose I just want that info I want it so freaking bad So that's kind of why like I love this idea I love litigation because I'm I'm literally going to tell these people like "You give me all this information and you hook me up and you and you show me how this works and you help me enter into this zone I'll drop this lawsuit You won't pay me a penny." And that's also very powerful Do you see you're right And that's why we have to you know be able to exchange this kind of information about these suits right and and uh I mean and I I'm really hopeful that I don't have to have a non-disclosure right that's I want to get as much out on the table Well I've done a lot of research They always always always always always make that part of the deal right but I can you know talk about everything up to that point as long as I don't give away identifying information and you know still be covered because you know we want to know what what's going to be effective right and and you know that if I know that oh you know well we settled it that means that I came out on top because yeah otherwise well here's well the the settlement the way settlement works just so you know from all the research I've done there's a couple things to say about this that I've never said because this is all like I'm learning all this right first and foremost the settlement is not really them admitting guilt to anything no absolutely not so it's kind of a weird complex thing where you're not saying like I won you kind of won but you kind of Uh sort of It's kind of a weird thing You wouldn't say that they admitted guilt I I would say that it it is a win but it is obviously like that the other side is saving face right because even if they might even be able to be victorious in the end but it would cost them too much Yes that's true Yeah You you've too difficult of an adversary or the PR angle is too difficult right yeah Yeah So so it doesn't but it doesn't tell you what the law rules right because they're conceding So all you can do is up to that point right you know okay were there any motions that were ruled upon uh was there evidence allowed to be admitted like what what happened right before they decided to settle what did you did you do something because if you did right then that's that's the thing that made them settle right so I think we can still learn um quite a bit from the experience even if in the end right there's not a complete adjudication And I think it's the I think the only time you'd end up going all the way to a verdict in a case like this is if you mess up in some big way So either you're completely ignorant and you get made a fool of on a deposition or testimony Yeah or you submit arguments or documents that could be fraudulent or right like or if you try to use a sovereign citizen argument or talk about the straw man um you know that kind of stuff like anything you bring up you have to be able to prove right so I wouldn't go in there and say you know anything about the all caps name or my agency unless I can prove it uh so you know I would use just evidence I wouldn't um come up with some you know story about an or I wouldn't mention the Cesta KV Act of 1666 Yeah that's this this is a this is a conversation that I've played in my head a million times because I'm always I'm moving in this direction So I I project right and I think of myself in a courtroom I you know many hours a day honestly and and the the truth is is that you know from my own research and my own my own idea and my own self-reflection it's sort of like uh you you it's a very simple conversation It's it's if you admit that this thing on this piece of paper is is me as the human man then that means that this is now a common law court and I have all the rights of of of a natural human uh uh of of a a real man Is that where you want this to go and they're going to say absolutely not Okay fine So we're actually in agreement that you know what I mean like like you can you can even pitch it in that direction in the opposite direction where it's like look if you want to say that this is me I'm actually cool with it because that means that I have all my human rights and we're going to go to an article 3 court and it means all these horrible things that are just going to absolutely decimate you in like 10 seconds So if you want to say that's me I'm actually cool with it You know what I mean it actually benefits you and it benefits me to say that this thing is an inslegious Uh which which the law obviously proved that out as well but it's it's just kind of convoluted But if you want to cut through all the convoluted just say "Hey look if you want to say this is me dude I'm actually down." I actually don't have a disagreement with that because now now I reserve all my rights and now I'm a human and now you're really in trouble You see the difference so so so I don't think the the court would allow that because they would never allow that They would never allow that because because they would lose jurisdiction like this Boom Jurisdiction's gone They would also say that because the way you're talking about it right is that you'd be basically claiming ownership over the name but they'll say that you you're not the owner Exactly That has been uh adjudicated uh in a courtroom before But I'm just saying like like I'm not going to be the one on the defensive basically like like what I've realized in the past few weeks is I'm going to be on the offensive the whole time if you come after me You're not the wrong the party who's wrong That's what I mean though That's what I mean though It's like it's like it all comes down to what's in your head right so it's like you think I'm going to be on the defensive and be like I'm going to prove this and prove that Like no Look you want to say that's me bro I'm all about it You want to say that it's it's a conditional acceptance too which is what I teach in my courses What it's hey look you you think that's me You want to say that's me I'm actually down bro But this these are going to be this is going to be what's going to happen if you agree to that And the judge is going to run in from  center field and be like no But I'm just saying like if you between me and the prosecution or me and the defendant like hey you want to say that i'm actually down bro But I want you to know if you if we do that and that's what you think it is it's blah blah blah blah blah all this stuff like and I'm going sit there like this like "Hey you know what I mean if you if that's what you think it is like dude let's go bro Let's go." You know what I mean it all depends on on on many different in many different factors too But it's it's just there there's a c we we had this conversation over the phone where it's like there's a certain point where it's no longer about the information It becomes a a spiritual emotional honorable intentionbased battle where it's just like you have a bunch of facts you have a bunch of facts and it gets up to a certain point where it's just like who has more confidence who knows what they're saying more who has more passion who has more devotion who has more intention in what it is that they believe and they're saying And there hits a certain point I believe that that's where the battle really occurs because because you and I can both agree and anyone who understands this information anywhere close to what we're talking about in this podcast that the facts are all horseshit It's all horseshit We're I mean I mean negotiable instruments and all this fin it's it's it's literally all just a joke None of it even exists All a joke It's just a game It's a a monopoly game the very sophisticated one right yeah So so so for me there there it's like logic logic logic logic logic logic And then above that it's just like bro like I will spiritually burn this whole city to the ground for what I know to believe to be true just correct And if you think you're going to stop me and you think you're going to sway me and you think I'm not going to get this done you're delusional It's never going to happen You know having this uh belief in yourself and confidence is vital because you know there going to be a lot of attempts right to get you to doubt yourself to second guessess um or to be to induce fear Oh god so common uh because oh you're going to you know owe debt we're going to garnish your wages lean your bank account put you in debtor's prison all these kind of things So you you have to be confident um in in the you know in your opinion of the information such that you are emotionally grounded Yes Right And have this composure because and you are in the right Right And I and I have to actively remind myself of this thing because when I do you know check the mailbox right and I see there's another uh you know letter or threatening foreclosure or you know some other thing like that right it's like well gosh you could But then then I go back and sit in my house and I realize everything is just fine And uh this is all just part of the game of sending paper around and eventually we'll you know justice will uh come to be right and then you know they won't send me threatening paper anymore They'll just send me the regular paper right so you have to be kind of in that state of mind in order to go through this Right so if you're afraid of your own shadow then this is this is not uh the right um path uh for you to go right now perhaps Well I was terrified for a long time I was terrified for a long time I mean all those letters and all that stuff I mean it just scared the out of me Uh but I just I just I just said you know I I know this is right I know this is true and I just have to I don't know just keep going I you know and and once you get through that first run especially like the first time you do any of this stuff you know you come out the other end and then it's just like way easier the next time and then it's way easier the next time and it's just like it's just like anything else It's like hitting on girls at a bar It's just like getting a new job or going getting job interview It's just like moving to a new city It's all the same It's just life We're talking about life here We're not talking about some crazy esoteric totally everyone listening to this has experienced what we're talking about It's just that it's it's in a new zone It's a new area but it's relative to everything you've ever experienced in your entire life It's the same It really is That's right You can always you know lose things right everything you do that's worthwhile is taking a risk You drive your car you you could run into a moose and uh you know lose your life at any time right and this you know you you might uh you might lose possessions you might have uh you know re repo men uh following you around um whatever But any material object can always be replaced right and uh in the end right we will be able to enjoy the full benefits that we're supposed to uh if we you know keep focused um on the truth and um you know don't give in to that kind of fear and intimidation So Brandon I feel like we've been going for a couple hours and um we we've covered quite a lot of ground right yeah This is this is going to be cool for my audience because this that we're talking about a lot of things in this show that I haven't really talked about yet because I'm a little careful in what I talk about I try to get into it study it for a long time at least kind of dip my fingers into it and then I kind of start talking about it Um there's a huge delay between when I start researching something and when I start talking about it Um and and a lot of this is stuff that everyone's asking me all the time that I just refuse to talk about up until pretty much this point Uh I think a lot of it comes down to how impressive your documentation is Uh to be honest with you it's it's it's a I can tell you've really put a lot of effort and time and and into this and it's just really um it's really impressive like to the point where I would I would go so far as to say you know anybody that that thinks that I'm some kind of professional in this area I would say that I would I would consider you like my equal honestly truly uh in a lot of ways cuz the the the documentation and how much you've you've you've spent on this and how far you've you've gone down the rabbit hole on this and how much you've uh if if anything else that you teach and anything else that you talk about uh involving natural health or anything else is anywhere close to as well researched and documented as what I've seen you do with this Uh it's very impressive Very very impressive Well you know listen what I when I'm passionate about someone um something uh I you know can't I get obsessed almost um because I just want to learn and I I'm thirsty for knowledge and understanding and it's just something that's driven me in my life and especially when it could result in some form of achievement of justice and this is really right in that area as is healthcare right so they've both been things that I've been passionate about and and yes you're right I just dive in like you do um you know read and listen to everything I can find and then once I got that threshold of confidence I started actually doing these things and and yeah I didn't really have success uh yet fully right some minor successes but I still persist because I know right um that that this is really the way things work I just don't have quite all the answers because of that complexity that's put in here I I believe purposely to make it really really difficult Oh God Yes for you to you know fully realize um you know your capabilities uh and um how you're supposed to engage uh with this system So you know I'm very honored by your compliments Um and uh but we'll see you know what what does the other side think of what I've written what is the judge going to think of it when a judge gets assigned and you know that will be the real test And um you know I will be sharing at least parts of these documents um to help other people see you know how I write the reasoning um uh related to some of these things Uh and it's really quite simple I mean I I just make sure everything's included But uh you know I find the law source and I look up um what it takes to make that argument and then I I just put in some basic elements um you know to refer to that and um you know I I'm lucky because my experience in the past involved being an expert witness and yes writing documents for the court and reading uh court documents and so that gave me you know to sit down and write a legal document And I I have experience with that already even if I haven't litigated So but it it's definitely it you know I'm at creative writing or writing something that's engaging to readers I'm terrible at right i can write scientific writing legal writing like stuff that's cut and dry analytical Um so you know um in a way I feel always feel like my writing is um could be a lot better But this is not fancy writing right this is this is basically write it clear make a clear argument you know use logic right uh set up the thing you know first A happened then B happened A plus B equals C You know that's all you have to do in it's a little depressing in that way Yeah it's it's it is very because I'm the opposite I guess of you I'm I'm more of I'm almost like a I'd almost go so far as to say I'm more like a woman I want to I want to get into all the feelings I want you to I want you to cry and laugh See that's why you're going to be great you know at a trial because you get up there you do that for your opening statement right and then you you'll engage them Um and that'll be very uh very useful But but I can see in in general in general action this is definitely more of a male demographic area up until trial and then I would say yeah it becomes more of a a a 5050 or maybe even like a 6040 on the female end of the spectrum But um there are women who have taken this quite far In fact um I studied with uh a woman to learn equity process uh Rebecca Rodriguez and we we have a uh done a discussion like this as well Um so you know this isn't a barrier uh certainly for anyone but it you do have to draw on your masculine energy because you know the a legal matter is adversarial by definition Yes Right So you're now you you know it's literally war Yes So so you have to be prepared to you know engage in that um and not ingratiate yourself But you know there's advantages also to being a woman in this uh arena as well because you may be able to you know weaken a man just through your No very true So true So um I you know it's approachable anyone of of either gender right of either of the two genders Uh can certainly What about Zar Zims huh would you look at look at his reaction here no zer allowed Get the levity in there a little bit You know what I mean you've got to have a little fun in this material [Laughter] Zurims don't have any rights which is very sad It's it's all just a big ploy You know it's the it's the the they them and the zerims You're not a you're not a man or a woman anymore if you're one of those things So you don't have any rights So it's it the whole thing is a campaign to strip you of your rights And I like to I like to communicate it as that because what it does is it sort of it it it doesn't really make those individuals who may think that way wrong necessarily It just it just it's it's a it's an it's a it's a warning I give it as a warning It's full it's full disclosure They deserve full disclosure And the full disclosure is if you want to do that you are you are relinquishing your rights as a man or a woman And if you want to continue down that path you deserve to know that And if you want to do that after fully realizing that of what you were about to do that's your choice That's kind of how I pitch it Uh because otherwise you end up getting deplatformed or whatever Not I don't I don't pitch it specifically to not get deplatformed That's really how I think of it Yeah Well many of you know the sort of uh cultural arguments uh let's say that are put forth that would seem to create you know more fairness uh more people getting along with each other and such Right and they sound really good and the language that they use makes it very attractive right that we can uh all love each other and live super happy and free lives But those things in actuality are the exact opposite of that They are kind of that's the way that they sell it to us Um but if you look beneath the surface at the actual policies at the actual laws you'll see that it's bringing about um everything but uh those desirable characteristics And the truth is is that if we want to have harmony and tolerance and acceptance and uh you know teamwork and collaboration and solidarity we have to each work personally on those things ourselves uh those are you know we can't force everyone to uh behave the way that we would like them to behave um you know of course we have to kind of not allow them to infringe upon our rights directly right that so we have to have some kind of uh rule of law But really if we want to make a great nation a great world a great home um a great congregation a great friendship a great community it's always up to the members of those entities through their own action and effort That's the only way to create those things and to relate with each other in those godly ways Yeah Yeah And it's so it's so interesting because even a lot of these groups and a lot of these things that you're seeing pop up now uh what a lot of people don't realize is under 50USC section 842 it actually states that uh anyone who is a a who prescribes to or is a successor to or a subsidiary organization to the Communist Party basically does not have any rights in America So you also have to realize too is that there's a lot of trickery that's tricking people especially young people into joining communist related activities we shall say And again it's all about deterioration of rights because the zerims and the they them and all that they're they've just burned all their rights in a trash can And all the communist people who get tricked into communistic behaviors or communistic groups they've just burned all their rights straight in the dumpster straight out of the United States code So it's one of those things where it's a it's a weird world we live in where there's a lot of trickery trying to get you to believe as though you are doing something beautiful when in fact you are destroying yourself And then what happens is the the mind as you know has a tendency to to defend that of which someone has decided upon and and the more a person has invested in that of which they have decided upon the larger the fortress is that will defend those particular So the way that the whole system is built in these communist factions is they get a person to join or or perform in sort of some some sort of communist faction and then they the they have them contribute and contribute and contribute and contribute and the more they contribute then the more invested they are the more invested they are then the more willing they are to defend that of which they have been invested in So what it is is it's very sad because then you have someone who who joins something that appears on the surface to be very very good and very very wonderful and then six months later now they've they've entirely encased themselves inside of this thing of which they will almost die for and they they can't get out because they they don't understand that their their own mind they've let it in and then now they defended it and then now they're they're a prisoner of it and that's the very very depressing I I don't I try not to do too much direct uh uh uh deg degradation to toward those people because I feel like I have a little bit of empathy toward that situation myself Not not that I excuse the behavior necessarily Uh but but it's it's it's it's understand your enemy That's what the Sunzu law number one Know thy enemy Uh and and that's kind of the entire basis of my entire platform Uh and I try so hard to to to do that You know you know there were such sophisticated um methods of mass you know manipulation right the whole public relations industry was sort of founded upon that We have you know uh psychologists talking about this things like mass formation right which is kind of what you just described how it can happen on a large scale and you know identity politics is another way to that right so we're you know for us to take on this like we we've had to first overcome all of that and realize you know that that that all is not really what's going on that's not the real truth and uh Brandon I want to wrap it up but uh you know yeah sure totally we could probably talk all night huh where uh where's you know tell people where to find you again And definitely if you haven't already uh sign up for his contract killer course Uh that's the core material You'll get to know uh Brandon and um be introduced to all these topics and it's a great springboard uh for further study and to head towards litigation right which we talked about tonight So like I said it's a it's a be with us and butad slash uh uh Jerry Springer show but uh you know the the clean version is don't be a slave.com or you can go to brandonjo williams.com but it will redirect you to put your main web address in the show notes below And I I appreciate you not using such colorful language here but So let me say it It's onesttofuck.com All right there you go I've now I'm no longer a virgin Perfect So uh yeah it's worth checking out and and the website has extensive uh resources including you know all the statutes that we mentioned tonight I guarantee are listed there uh in reference and uh the language of many of them is there uh as well So it it's a great uh resource uh that you should not pass up And everything is 100% free Um unless you want to buy some pickle uh paraphernalia That is so true That is so true All right Thank you I appreciate this so much I uh I would love to get a copy of this for my audience This has been fantastic It's definitely a one of the one of the most advanced
