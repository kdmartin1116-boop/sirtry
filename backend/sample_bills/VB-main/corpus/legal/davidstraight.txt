Fayetteville Arkansas that's where this is being held the area near Fayetteville Arkansas and it's a religious
organization as it's called and we put this together here and invited David straight because we have heard that
david straight has some fantastic information to bless people in the areas
of life as they interact with so-called government and potentially government and non-government as you will hear
tonight when he gives his presentation and we're going to examine the things that he has to share with us and and the
things that we can apply to our lives to alter our life and take the boot off our neck and to find freedom from oppression
that's what looking for in this hour we've understood that he offers some information for people that are under
the heavy hand of child protective services and child child trafficking
information at this particular time I'm understanding that David has been serving on to executive task forces
right now Presidential Task Forces won't have to do with child trafficking the other having to do with corruption and
government and having been a Navy Seal and intelligence officer and a deputy
sheriff yeah by the way silence your phones that's a good idea it's a good morning good morning they're having served as a
deputy sheriff and a part owner in a what was it David help me out here was a
mortgage company or a title company you said start and ran 13 businesses we're

downstairs so you can stay for the presentation right now we're going to just dive right in to let David
take it take it away with our presentation could you please give a warm welcome to david straight thank you
that's enough I don't like too much fanfare I'm uh I'm usually a really
quiet humble person and I spoken to a lot of groups so I'm not scared to speak
in front of you but you know I don't I don't need any kind of recognition for
what I do I do this for one reason one reason only is because I love people and
I believe we have been under a system of
corruption for far far too long and it's because of the lack of communication I
believe the people that founded this country were basically good honest and moral people who wanted a better life
and that's why they went through some extreme life struggles to get here and to do the things they needed to do do I
believe they were all good and perfect no and I can prove they weren't but they
had a good basic moral character I need to move my mic or something yeah I hear
that bad so anyway that's gonna be hard
cuz I I'm a walker and a talker anyway
there are certain things I want to get across to you one I want you guys to get
simple I want you to get basic and I say that coming from a position of somebody
who you just talk really fast walk really fast do everything really quick I could get out debate just about
everybody on a variety of subjects I'm very well educated I've got five degrees
why I don't know just because I've been studying my whole life I study three
four or five hours a day sometimes still two three o'clock in the morning every opportunity I can get
now the problem with that is I spent 20 years in this business making it
complicated and I'm trying to drum this into Daniels head a little bit 20 years making it
complicated there's too many things going on out there too many things happening and we can we can file writs
of mandamus and habeas corpuses and we can do all kinds of variety of things administrative processes and stuff and
we can make this business incredibly complicated or we can solve in five
minutes making it simple okay that's the point I want to get across I want to
make it simple for you well I'm gonna talk about perceived power and authority and I'm gonna show you a couple of
things even a couple of things I didn't tell the guys last night to kind of show
you how we got to where we are today and how things have came down through
history and the reason why we're so oppressed I traveled the entire world
every just about every nation every continent for sure just about every
state and everywhere I go I realized one important thing we're less free in
America than any other country I visit pretty much we are less free here than
just about anywhere in the world I had 48 years of misconception of
propaganda about China China is a
country with a huge population lots of cities of 10 14 20 million people in a
city they got almost no crime very few police officers most of them none of
them that I saw had a gun on them they're all standing on street corners helping little old ladies across the
street with their bags in helping tourists on directions you never seen a
cop on the major freeways you'll see a cardboard or plywood cutout of a cop car
seeing police so slow down to protect your fellow neighbors it'll say that I went to lunch
two-hour lunches with groups of engineers very smart intelligent people who are living in million-dollar
apartments who are making 70 80 90 thousand dollars a year American
equivalent who are driving seventy thousand dollar cars because China puts a ten thousand dollar tax on every
vehicle and they've got two thousand
dollar laptops sitting on the seat the weather is warm and their windows are
rolled down and the sidewalks right in front of their car and hundreds of people are walking back and forth and
when we all get out of the car and I know their laptops are sitting there and they start walking into the restaurant
and I go hey wait a minute aren't you gonna roll up the windows and lock the cars and they look at me and they go why
no steal anything they won't reach in that car and I said they won't
they won't steal anything what do you mean he said because 25 time
they're walking down the sidewalk with tackle him beat him to death and hold him for the police we don't worry about
that and we go in the restaurant we're in there for two hours we come back there's laptops car windows are all the
way down all the way not just this far and nobody steals them and during that
two hours I'll bet you a hundred thousand people walk down that sidewalk I mean they're 14 wide going every which
way lots of people it's like New York at rush hour times 2 and nobody steals
anything they think it's a sin for their older people to die in the hospital they
have to die a home in their own bed taken care of by their family they take care of their kids they take care of
their elderly the heck's wrong with us here that's what I'd like to know I
didn't know China was that way I thought they were this communist country they're our government sells us into and I was
an intelligence officer I was in the Navy I thought that's the way it was then I go to China
not once two three four times in a period of three or four years I go wow
what a beautiful country now they do have some smog that was a problem but they're cleaning that up right now and
actually right now they're going through a little bit of a depression since Trump took office but that's gonna change
they'll pull themselves out of it because they're hard-working good moral honest people and the government is easy
to spot they all drive black Audi cars now ta sevens and eights and black Audi
a6 s depending on the ranking government they get a lower number say and a higher
number the higher the rank and they all drive these black Audi's and so the
people they just say oh yeah they're government guy he get paid well he leave us alone they don't care it's like they
don't even exist and they don't fool with them unless they're doing something dramatic they don't follow the people in
China are freer than we are in 1992 Russia Russia signed the ICCPR the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and they rewrote their entire Nations constitutions and they
started holding elections for the first time a Putin was put in place and his people loved him and they flourish under
it and he does well and he's sharp he's decisive he doesn't let him get away
with corruption and so they keep re-elected him they don't have terms like we have here they'll just reelect
somebody as many times as they think he's doing good till he's old and senile and then they think they throw him out
and put somebody else new and Russia since 1993 has been a freer country than we are we get fed a whole line of crap
propaganda from our own government I'll tell you what I go to Russian there's
some of the smartest nicest sweetest best people ever and they take care of their neighbors
and they take care of their young and they take care of their elderly the
misconceptions we have in America are unbelievable we live under such a slave
system and other than the other 13
English Commonwealth that are along with us every other country is pretty free
you can do just about anything you want here you want to change the light bulb
you got to get it electrical permit just about you got to tell your County what you're doing to build a shed right I
mean to fix your own sewer system you got to get a permit you got to get a
license for something you give every time you bow to perceived Authority you're giving up a right in exchange for
a privilege what does the word privilege
mean we all were taught what that's
something good no it's not it's not something good to have a privilege it's
terrible it's a sin it's to take upon
sin as what a privilege is we're all taught wrong on purpose let me give you
a couple of couple of things in history that'll they'll tell you this in 1951
our federal government created this wonderful older schoolteacher lady named
Jane Spalding and they paraded her around the country to all 50 states to
sell the state governments on the auspice of standardized education and
government funding to the schools and
government funding to the states my throat gets really dry because I got
poisoned back in March okay so anyway I
apologize for that but I'm gonna be doing that a lot so anyway they parade
her around for two years and if you could close your eyes and picture the most perfect schoolteacher in your mind
that was James Paul she literally was next to perfect and they said she was
going to be the head of the Department of Education that's what she salt was
sold on so April 11th 1953 they the 50th
state finally signed off and they made James Spaulding the head of the Department of Education 49 days later 49
days later the president United States fired Jane Spalding and appointed Nelson
Aldrich Rockefeller to run the Department of Education and during his
acceptance speech in front of the media which was a group about this size so if
you were all media and I was Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller this is about the way the group was and he stood up there
at the podium and he said I consider
this the greatest position in government and the reporters hands all shot up and
the flash bulbs went off and the first reporter asked why do you consider this
the greatest position in government greater than the President of the United States and the Vice President and he
said absolutely this is the greatest position in government and they said why
because you give me one decade one generation and I'll change the minds and
therefore the direction of the world through the Department of Education and
it took him eight years he didn't it didn't even take him ten after by the end of the eighth year every school in
the United States had I'm gonna call them propaganda textbooks
I can get any history book and I can tell you that the whole thing is full of
lies stomp on it a little bit and it's clear full lies the bull grapple just
blow out of it and that's what happens see that's a that's problem to me
because I raised ten kids eight of my own two adopted yeah
and my kids all grew up to be very sharp independent well-educated kids who are
taking care of their own family and I got 15 grand kids and I didn't raise
them very much in the public school system the majority of their first 13 years they were taught at home okay so a
couple other things Nelson Rockefeller said during that speech they said how
much money did you make last year Nelson and he says I made a hundred and forty
million dollars I think the head of the Department of Education in 1953 was paid
about thirty thousand so we're right in their neighborhood okay why would you
take a $30,000 a year position when you made a hundred forty million last year
anybody answer that one if you didn't think you could change the world by doing that it's the only reason right it
wasn't for the money right they asked
him how much did you pay in taxes and he pulls a Indian Head Penny out he tosses it in the audience he says not one red
cent that was a pretty racist comment today he'd be crucified for that one but
anyway Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller ran
the Department of Education for eight years and our school systems haven't been the same since little tiny
kids every year they get up on stage four score and seven years ago they
talked about good old Honest Abe right man who never told a lie spaces out Mount Rushmore see I spent two years in
the National Archives in Washington DC I figured out the only way to learn history is to read letters and journals
of people who live during the time get their opinion put those opinions
together and that's how you learn real history because you're sure you're gonna learn it in a textbook textbook is all
lives every darn word of it so the first thing you do is throw away all those
textbooks those are the books that should be burned all right so let's talk
about good old Honest Abe right it is a Bar Association attorney well it
didn't stay to Illinois go to the state of Illinois website today go to the
office of the Attorney General click on the history tab and it says the office
of the Attorney General of the state of Illinois was put into place to protect and uphold the interests of the crown
the crown the crown Inc okay
good old England and it's monarchs that's what the crown the crown was a
crown Inc was the very first corporation in the world okay so let's talk about
able a little bit he was a follower of Karl Marx Karl Marx wrote the communist
manifesto in 1848 okay he passed a whole bunch of Communists ik
laws that are still today screwing up Illinois okay terrible state to live in
and they're still screwing up Illinois I'm gonna be there on the 19th of this month it's speaking in Chicago and he
messed it up he was the governor of Illinois and he ran for president five
times and he failed why did he fail five times because the people didn't like the
Communists Abe Lincoln not the story we
read in our textbooks is it not the story at all that we put up on Mount Rushmore
in fact he wrote a letter that said it was up to me I never would have freed
the slaves those were words right on aids of mouth he never would have freed
the slaves civil war wasn't even about slavery it was about the Morrill Act
senator Morrill wrote an unfair tax bill that taxed the farmers of the south a
higher percentage rate than the manufacturers and bankers of the north
so 11 delegates from seven southern states walked out of Congress leaving
congress sinned I was that mean that's
right that means it died that day Congress died that day another thing how
did he be finally become president a 6-time his opponent had $5,000 to run
his campaign with aim Abe Lincoln because of the bankers of Boston and
Chicago Philadelphia New York had seven million dollars in his campaign you know
how much money seven million dollar $5,000 was a lot of money when somebody made 20 bucks a month and Abe Lincoln
had seven million dollars so all they did is plastered his face everywhere they put it on Billboard's on the sides
of trains Hecky he paraded on a camp hang on the train train had come into
town there'd be ass down at the back surrounded by red white blue well having there everybody shaking hands kissing
babies right and he became president United States except for one thing he
couldn't be present in the United States why couldn't he be because the first
Constitution had 13 amendments the 13th amendment was called the Tona amendment
title of nobility act and no bar attorney could become present so what did he do first stay on in the job he signed an
executive order bankrupting the United States of America next executive order created a corporation out of Delaware
under the United States he made himself a CEO not only that he put the Grand
Army of the Republic in charge by another executive order and then he made himself commander-in-chief of the army
that's why every president sworn in as commander-in-chief and president of the corporation since then every prison
citizen no present before Abe Lincoln
ever signed an executive order why didn't they because they weren't an
executive you can't be an executive unless you're an executive of a company
we had a de jure government up at to that point in 1860 want to became de
facto a lot of people think it was 1871 when when the District of Columbia
Corporation was set up but no it started in 1861 with a blanket starting his
first month in presidency in 30 days he wrote a hundred executive orders no
president prior that had ever written one one hundred executive orders you
know what executive order number 100 is anybody that's right it was Libre code it put the nation
under martial rule that's different than martial law martial rule
put the military in charge of the cup of the country and until the Posse
Comitatus Act except for that act military is in charge of the country but
because of that act they're not allowed to get in balled in civil matters then
how come I've had a provost marshal general in court twice how did I get him
involved in civil matters because I don't I said I don't care if you know the defendants name I don't care if you
know what what he's charged with I don't care if you know his attorney or any of
it any of his actions at all I don't want you involved in a civil matter I said I want you there because you're in
charge of this judge he's under your purview and he's committed capital
felony treason show up and watch okay show up and watch
anybody know who Tim home SEF is you guys are sitting way too far back there
guys in the back row come forward all
right because I'm gonna write stuff and you're not gonna be able to see it I couldn't see it from halfway so anyway
anybody know who Tim whole Seth is nobody that's not a long as shocking to
me tim has been a reporter for an award-winning reporter for the last 10
or 12 12 plus years I know it's been at least 12 years okay and he's being
persecuted right now in the state of Minnesota by an attorney firm in the
state of Florida and he's being persecuted in Minnesota for releasing
information that was already public don't we have freedom of speech and
freedom of the press and and all he's doing is releasing the information
that's already on the public record and he's taken and he's putting it on the Internet he's telling everybody about it
and they're persecuting him you know what they did they got a gag order a
protection order against a lady who is committing child and sex trafficking in
Florida and she's an attorney for a big attorney firm in guess which County
Broward County Florida which is one of the most corrupt in the nation and she is taking him to court every month she's
suing him for something to keep him tied up spending his resources spending his time so he can't do any reporting
because he called her out on something that was already on a court record down there so it's not like he went to
Florida and did investigative journalism and found out something that nobody else had it's not proprietary information
it's public record and he's just taking what's already on the record
and out there right it's not illegal in any way shape or form so she sued him in
the state of Florida and his life was threatened if he showed up in court
he'd never set foot in the state of Florida in his life he's never been there and his life was threatened so he
didn't go and so they've got a protection order yes sir he says no problem I'm not gonna go down
there and bother you they didn't think anything of it so she's enforcing the board of
protection order in Minnesota where he lives every time he puts something out
on the Internet and they keep hauling him into jail and I didn't learn about
Tim until his second trial was coming up after his first one and the first one he
went there Hanks railroaded and found guilty and put in jail for 45 days and I
went up there and I got him out of jail on the 41st day whoop-dee-doo seen him for days of his life right but then we
walked out the door on the 41st day and the sheriff walked over into Russia called him back in the door we didn't
get 25 feet and they dressed him so I
flew back home and started helping Tim
with a little bit of paperwork over the phone and his next trial date came up about 30 days later and I leave Bend
Oregon and I go you know what Kirk Pendergrass anybody know Kirk
Pendergrass hey guys all right start watching Kirk's Law
corner Kirk has an IQ of about a hundred
and fifty-five he's sharp his attack everything he reads he remembers and the
page number okay he's got one of those photographic memories and he can read the law and
know the law better most attorneys so I'm leavin been in a bit
are about ready to drive to Minnesota and I call up Kirk and I say hey you got
a bag packed I said I'll be there in four and a half hours
Kirk says four and a half hours that's not enough time I'm not going anywhere so I wait two hours when I get to Burns
Oregon that calleth Kirk up I said hey Kirk two and a half hours away I'll be there at your house to pick you up I
told him the situation he says okay I'll go stop his house picked him up we shot
up to Minnesota right out of Great Falls North Dakota just across the border
little town called Crookston in fact all three counties there have a population of about 10,000 people it's almost to
Canada it's way up there all right and I pick her cup and we show up with Tim in
court and Kirk and I stand in court
under a clause LLC and presidential executive orders and we speak an hour in
20 minutes on behalf of Tim and I in that court we called the judge out three
times on the record for capital felony treason and it went unrebutted he knew
he committed it so he dismissed the case and recused himself 30 days later
they're hauling him back into court again we've done this five times now five judges the last time we had 150
people show up from all over the world court from England Phoolan to his court
and Tim didn't show and he didn't show
because literally on public television they threatened to kill him if he showed
up so he didn't show so we had a waffle
strategic plan in place in case that happened and Kirk went in the courtroom
and took care of some business the judge still issued a warrant because he didn't
show but when you read the warrant you'll giggle it's only for a misdemeanor and it's
only good in that County in Minnesota so as long as he stays out of that County
they're not gonna pick him up right so we've got him stationed in a safe house
and he's fine but we're just gonna fight it on the higher level because they just one judge
after another in this courtroom and they just keep committing capital felony treason yeah and they're doing that in
every courthouse in the United States every single courthouse in the United States every day they're committing
capital felony treason on you on all of us every one of our neighbors that has
to walk in that courtroom and the problem is they've been getting away
with it for too long far too long that's why we're really here today see we were
at war there are two wars going on in the world right now and it ain't Afghanistan in Iraq okay it's not with
another nation one war is going in on inside that group and the other war is
going on between
the bankers have an army they are called attorneys the Bar Association works for
the bankers under the crown Inc versus
We the People this is the wor word fighting every one of us are fighting
this war today and it's a one of the most costly and bloodiest Wars in the
history of mankind you couldn't do this much damage with a1 tanks and howitzers
as they're doing to us today they're stealing our children they're stealing
our property and they're stealing our lives many many millions of people in
our prison systems and every organization like Harvard University
Cornell Yale have all done Studies on our prison systems these are them doing
studies and they've determined that between 41 and 69 percent of the prison
population does not belong there has committed no crime 41 to 69 percent
depending on which of those studies you read that's half let's just call it 50%
break in the middle half of our prison population doesn't belong there right
down the road here at this little gas station when you walk in there to buy a body armor to the counter and the
counter is about this tall and you put it up there right next to us a newspaper that they sell for two bucks which is
just a picture after picture after picture of the criminals in this area
who are being sought after by the law oh my gosh I started reading to some of
those I can grab there she goes that's 2 bucks I said I don't want to buy it I just want to look at it and I walk to
her and I started thumbing through there and I'm looking what these people or being accused of
at least 50% of them didn't commit a crime and here's her pitchers on their
public slander they're being slandered their reputations are being destroyed
well I don't look like you guys right because it could be one of us right
some sovereign citizen somewhere well joke about that for a while but no such
thing as a sovereign citizen we've had 44 out of 45 presence stand in front of
the cameras and say the people are sovereign 44 out of 45 have said that in
front of the camera I know I've read every presidential speech every one
court back to Washington's and the people are sovereign
I'm sovereign that's why I'm using a purple pen right it's got a purple pen
in my pocket all right dead is black will this contract read is
living Purple's royalty okay no your ink colors they're important they're
important on your documents another
thing I want to mention briefly is
inside that circle you could stick the name of any organization or agency in
our in our government our perceived government and right down the middle of
that you could build the Great Wall of China and on one side you're gonna have
order followers and on the other side
you're gonna have the best of the best of the brightest there are in their
given field people that have saved the world saved you every one of you over
and over and over again I don't care if this is a CIA don't say
anything bad about them because you're sitting here because of them otherwise you'd be dead and buried there are
people in every one of those agencies who have saved this country single-handedly by themselves and I can
tell you story after story after story I told some of you already some of them
don't talk bad about an agency it has nothing to do with agency has to do with
you government operates through the consent of the governed if I was going
to rattle off about key points in about 20 Supreme Court cases it goes something
like this since governments have chosen to
incorporate themselves they must follow the same rules as any other corporation
that rules statutes ordinances even executive
orders are not law they are not law they
are corporate bylaws there are four employees of the corporation to follow
who are the employees of their corporation you every one of you was
made an employee very first day you were born a paper was filed to the Department
of Human Resources the HR department of the corporation just like when you go to
work as an employee for any other company you went to the HR department right after you were hired before you
could even start work and you filled out all your forms and you did all your stuff with HR and you sign up for your
health plan that probably didn't take effect for 90 days or whatever right all things that you do and the same thing
happened to you the day you were born I'm an ambassador for voice of youth and
over 50 sovereign nations have me do their work
and it keeps me really really busy besides this and besides getting over
270 children returned their parents in the last two years alone okay I don't
need fanfare but what I'm trying to say is this throw me off a little bit
governments operate through the consent of the governed to deprive us of our
rights under the color of law Title 18 section 241 and 242 it's a conspiracy so
that the United States Code get familiar with it because it was put
there for one reason one reason only it's so we the people can hold these
people Plus these people government
accountable that's it it's the only reason it was put there wasn't for them to hold us accountable
but they try to by making you an employee how do they make you employee
what I write it like that because city means municipal Zen is society it's a
municipal society you claim to be a citizen you're claiming to be an
employee of government why would you want to be that why would you want to be
a citizen of anything that's right it's
not in our textbooks is it kindergarten through twelfth grade we didn't learn her very much I can tell you that how
many law classes did you have wait a minute none 20 or 15 you got a permit in
yeah from that moment on you've been dealing with the law and he didn't have a single law class just don't understand our
education system so let's talk about
this one you remember 1999 Bill Clinton
sitting in front of Congress being interrogated charged verbally with some
crimes I should say alleged crimes cuz you know he never did that right this is
Arkansas I gotta be careful let's say in Arkansas regarding my friends the
Clintons anyway the last day of testimony he stood there all day and he
played with a door bill and he just played with it he rolled it up he did all kinds of things with it he folded it
and increased it he turned it over folded it back and he's until he got tired of listening and then he held it
up just like that and you could watch
about 25 heads in the room just nod congressional hearings are over and he
served out the rest his presidency to 2001 he never had to say a word he said
there all day didn't answer one question because he had the right to remain silent
pled the fifth but he held that up why what's it mean let's talk about what
it means this world there and I'm going
to start with telling you there's two of everything there's two of you
there's your all-caps name and then there's your upper and lower case first and middle name with your last name
tacked on okay but there's two of you
citizen person and resident
if you're any of those three or all of those three you need CPR does your dick
because you're dead you're dead all
right the dollar bill the all-seeing eye is
the Pindar Pindar this is the Council of 13 there's
13 bricks in that pyramid at the bottom how the pyramid has 300 bricks as the
Council of 300 if you draw an imaginary
line at that first layer of bricks and you draw a vertical lines down you can
write the name of every organization on earth on any of those lines you could
write that Mason's the Illuminati the the government of Fayetteville and the
government or whatever county this is in and whatever state were in and and you could write every government every
organization every Church that's a 501c3 any major churches Catholic Church
Mormon Church Baptist Church Protestant Church it doesn't matter you can write
every organization on it even Christ was against organized religions we need to
meet his neighbors we can hold church we're in two or more gathered together there am I also I am a Christian I'm a
firm believer in the Bible I'm a firm believer that there will attain salvation someday if we live righteously
and that we can repent for our sins but I'm telling you right now
even Christ knew man would corrupt any organization as people increase in their
level of power they get greedy envious
prideful just knew many of the seven deadly sins right and then some and that's what
happens to them and the minute they do that they go up into this pyramid that
is controlled and that's what's wrong
with every organization on earth now I'm not saying every single one of them are
but I'm saying there's a heck of a good chance see everything in life is about good versus evil one-third of the hosts
of heaven were what okay good versus
evil citizen person or resin it's three
things that are we never want to be in fact in the book of Job in five other
authors in the Bible have distinguished clearly between a man and a person job
32:21 what's the same says be the man and not the person 22 it says don't put
the flattering titles upon a man of a person we never want to be persons we're
not persons or people why didn't our founding fathers say we the people we
the people created government we lay the people laid down the law and right now
they're sure stepping outside of their scope and authority don't we the people laid down so why why are we we the
people every one of our documents that we file in court should say I am a man a
living soul a son of God I am one of we the people who created government
there's a maximal law that says that which one creates one controls you want
to control our perceived Authority then you better be a we the people which
means not a citizen a person or resident so you need to repudiate your
citizenship and the United States code title 8 section 1101 it says this is the
definitions of statuses in the United States everything in the law is about
status standing and jurisdiction status
standing and jurisdiction
you don't even know who you are none of us in kindergarten through twelfth grade
which I'm assuming most people have where you ever taught that there's a
whole bunch of different statuses lots of statuses why do you think Hillary
Clinton's never been arrested because we physically have to have proof and evidence of her physically harming
another person why because she knows her darn steps she's an American state
national she's an Arkansas not anymore
right they should move the heck out of here guys kick her out I hope so all right so why she's never been
arrested she has the dirty work done she doesn't do it herself right how do you
prove that she's harmed another person she doesn't do it herself take some pretty good evidence and
everybody complains how come we have an arrested Hilary yeah nobody would like to see that more than I would nobody but
we haven't I don't like talking politics
but huh thank you standing all persons are equal
in the law rich or poor black and white doesn't matter it's a little little
quote the Bar Association likes to throw out there occasionally another one they
throw out there that they don't like to admit to but they printed their ABA Journal every once a while is no factor
true she'll be trying to court it's a nice little model right no factor true
she'll be tried in court because they base everything off presumption assumption and hearsay jurisdiction
probably one of the most misused words in the law by our attorneys by our
attorneys the army of the bankers know
an attorney he was standing just passed the bar exam he's standing in Seattle at
the Space Needle and he's up on top at the restaurant they just had a big meal celebration he's standing there he's
looking out the window and one of the older attorneys came up to him and says
you see all that out there you see all those powerful corporations like
Microsoft and all that see all those guess who controls those not the CEOs
every one of those guys run to their corporate attorney attorneys control
those corporations not the CEOs of the company not their board of directors
they don't do anything until they run it past the legal department not a stinking
thing and he realized that a ssin that ever became an attorney because he
didn't want anything to do with that you see he's taken away somebody else's
control and authority can you all hear me I talk quiet okay every organization
on earth what is the word attorney mean
look it up in a legal dictionary it says an actor to a turn that's the definition
of an attorney an actor to a turn what is the legal definition of an actor it's
someone who gets up on stage and lies convincingly enough to make you believe in the character and the plot now
somebody who lies convincingly enough what is to a turn be it means to steal
from one and turn over to another so by the buried definitions of their professions they're
liars and thieves let's bake drop them all and make a pact never hire an
attorney for anything you don't need it because it takes three signatures to
steal your life it takes the judges the prosecutors and your attorney or you
your attorney or you that means you suck if you're in jail it's because you
signed a plea deal or your attorney signed your bond for you that put you in
jail so if you hire the attorney thinking he's gonna protect you and get you out of jail see I've gone to federal courts
where someone's actually been tried by a jury and found guilty of felonies and I
meet them right after their trial and before their sentencing and we walk in
and we nullify their trial and their sentencing how do we do that
we fired their attorney if you have an
attorney you are a ward of the state a ward of the court you're incompetent and unable to speak for yourself
how many of you want to be that if you
hire an attorney you're incompetent your infirmed you're a minor or a corporation
you are not a man or woman they cannot represent a man or a woman did you know
that it's against law it's against the law for any attorney to represent a man
or a woman they can only represent your entity your person your incompetent your
infirmed says outright in their laws who can an attorney represent a minor a
corporation a person somebody incompetent somebody infirm
that's it so you fire there your
attorney you don't sign anything
and you make sure you are competent
could be right could be wrong confident I've never been a good speller actually
want to sit down and think about it on the computer I'm pretty good but when I'm up here I'm thinking of me I'm trying to think ahead of myself
you get it wrong if you are competent and you don't sign anything and you
don't have an attorney you can't go to jail then you go home now they can throw
you in jail for contempt in fact they can throw you in jail for contempt three times they can throw you
in jail for contempt to try and force
you to have an attorney they can throw you in jail for contempt to try and
force you into a plea deal and they could throw you in jail for contempt to
get a competency hearing now the problem with incompetency it's a two-edged sword
for the court so they they believe me
they want you competent except in the state of New York they want you comedy
you stay in New York they want you incompetent because they make a lot of money off mental health facilities
without even being sentenced without a trial without due process a lot they can
put you in a health mental health facility for a year I just tell people
that tell them wait a minute I went to a government funded and controlled school
system for thirteen years and I got a certificate of competency called a diploma what do you mean I'm incompetent
I filed all these documents sue juris on
my behalf in this court what do you mean I'm incompetent I got this degree in that degree in that but a successful
businessman what do you mean I'm incompetent the judge goes crap I can't find him incompetent
so that's one of the easiest things to get around is to make sure you're competent so be confident don't have an
attorney and don't sign anything don't go to jail it's that simple even after you've been tried by a jury and
found guilty you'll stay out of jail save the lady twenty years of her life
before felony counts of fraud Jeana Nilson I saved her five years of the
life of her life Stephen in Utah forget
his last name he was gonna go for life life and he didn't do anything they
manufactured his case and he never spent a day in jail Jeana spent spent almost
90 days in jail 80 87 days because in
Utah they can hold you in jail up to 30 days for contempt most states it's like 72 hours but in you taiking to be up to
30 days a time so they hauled her jail for 29 days to try and force her to have
an attorney to break her down mentally and physically break her down so that
she had accepted an attorney and on the 29th day they hauled her in for a hearing and she said no I'm not gonna
have an attorney they put her back in
jail for contempt for 29 days to try and
force her into a plea deal and every time they walked in with a piece of paper to sign she said no I'm not
signing nothing they threw her back if she went in for a hearing they said
we're gonna order a complan C hearing we're gonna send a psychologist over to the to the jail he walks through the
door she goes you realize I have a degree in psychology right
she goes you realize I have two businesses I run an operating you do
realize that I filed over 700 pages of documents in this court right he goes
you're competent they hauled her back in for the hearing it was over in five
minutes as she walked out and hugged her mother I got a picture of it on my phone
she was already tried by a jury and found guilty okay three sentencing
hearings three and she was thrown in jail for contempt at every sentencing hearing because I can do that to try and
force you to break you down mentally and physically here's a line I want you all
know first of all any time you're dealing with Authority try to shut up
don't say anything that's the first thing you got to try and do because you
will incriminate yourself every time so try not to say anything I know people
that have been home rested strapped in thrown the back of a car halted the jail
gone through interrogation and they let him out because I didn't even say their name they just zip through it did say
word and then they go home I know quite a few people the last happen to you know
somebody that happened to see so that's the first thing second if you do have to
say something and deal with them be nice every one of those agencies there's good
people in even our Police Department's there's a lot of guys that started when they were this young saying daddy I'm gonna grow up to be a police officer so
I can help people and they don't realize that the one to get in there and they get on the job but they're nothing more
than a policy enforcement revenue collection agent because that's what they are police means policy
doesn't say well officer and say peace officer in fact the Supreme Court has
rolled several times now that they're not there to protect the public not only
that they're all private for-profit entities you guys ever run a dun &
bradstreet number or a Manta calm report on your city of Fayetteville or on the
county of whatever this is or on the police department or on the
courthouse I proved in the first District Court of Cache County Utah that
seven County courts in Utah were owned by one man whose headquarters offices
was in Ogden and he owned up just like a McDonald's franchise you think their
government on June the 20th I was
meeting Melania Trump in the Rose Garden I'm on one of her task forces and we
talked for about 20 minutes and it was real nice and talked about a lot of different things she gave me a little
letter thanking me for the evidence that I've turned into the Pentagon as a result in the rest of more than 3,000
child sex traffickers this year since March but President Trump came by and
I'll wear my hat tomorrow that he gave me President Trump came by and said some
nice things and gave me a hat and I'm thinking to myself what can I tell this
man cuz I'm not gonna get much time with him you know you're only gonna get a little a little bit what can I tell this man
that's gonna make some kind of a difference and the only thought that
came to my head was this I said
President Trump our 2018 census said there's 320 7.2
million people and you know stays today and the corporate charter
that set up this corporate government the Constitution says they're supposed
to be one representative in Congress for every 30,000 people I said that means we
need 10,000 907 congressmen and we have 435 and Congress operates off the Masons
meeting manual as their book on how to
conduct their meetings 435 out of 10,000
907 is not a quorum I said they're dead
they're sinned I I said no law that they
passed no executive order no nothing the
Congress does or the Senate does or any law that's written or approved means anything because there's no quorum
there's no lawful government everything is de facto which means without fact
it's all de facto they operate through the consent of the governed and he looks
at me and he says you know I know that and you're right and he says that's why
I signed executive order and I can never remember the numbers blah blah blah
restoring the Republic of the United States of America and now it's up to you
and I I just about burst into tears I said geez he knows our government has no
authority to even exist except through
the consent of the governed by the unknowing and uneducated and it's
believe me I'm not blaming anybody it's not your fault we were all educated through the same system and we're all
just compartmentalized legal idiots and we're stupid and that includes me
the smarter I think I am this dumber I know I okay
and I'm the first to admit that but yeah
a lot of them a lot of them evidence I turn in as a reason Epstein went to jail
he is absolutely dead no we have all of
his evidence he doesn't know we would have killed him anyway you have no idea
how many people that we go in their house in the middle of the night and we pick them up and we take them to the
nearest military base and we put them on c-130 sixes and they fly directly Guantanamo Bay and they're tried under
you'd see MJ which is much tougher than the Department of Justice there's four
of us on this task force that collect this evidence in the United States and
we've arrested over 3,000 people since March in that same period of time the Department of Justice which has four
hundred thousand people one hundred thousand to one has arrested 17 okay
the difference is the authority in which they arrest the Department of Justice rusts rust them they have to go through
a court system at trial and they pick a judge is probably a pedophile and they pick a prosecutor is probably a
pedophile and though black robes there's a reason they're not white robes okay
it's good versus evil there's a real reason they're not white
our biggest criminals sit on the bench and even bigger ones they're prosecutors
okay
once they've reset position of power now I shouldn't say that because there's a
lot of good ones still hi I've won judges over to our side okay but the
majority of them there's a reason they're there and there's a reason they're wearing black robes understand
they're in a for-profit system what is a court what is a court anybody went to
Black's Law Dictionary maybe fourth fifth edition under the word Court so
see Bank see Post Office all courts were set up as United States District postal
courts Benjamin Franklin set up the post office as a bank its currency was as
stamps and it's money orders that were backed by gold and silver the post offices were banks these were all post
roads every road in the United States was a post road still is believe it or
not the post roads postal system was
banks this country was founded on banking banks still banks still found on
banks every act of Congress between 1908 and 1933 was put into place by bankers
to enslave you every act of Congress
look no farther than Edward Mandell house a rich Texas oil billionaire who
had never served one day as an employee of government or had the ear of presidents and bankers he was a
billionaire and he had the ear of presidents and bankers how many people
know about Jekyll Island most people in this room probably because you've been
studying right Jekyll Island Edward
Mandell house got the bankers together and they all met on Jekyll Island and they come in with a way to enslave you
all and he had to year President Wilson when they set up the IMF and the World
Bank and the Federal Reserve and the Council on Foreign Relations and and many many banks and bank organizations
and they set it all up for a system of slavery they set apart United States Treasury the Secretary of the Treasury
does not get paid from the United States government what's up the International
Monetary Fund is where's Chuck comes from okay the International Monetary Fund that's
where his paycheck comes from one cannot serve two masters same with your County
Sheriff where's his check come from I don't care if we the people elected him
don't think he's ours because you didn't you're not writing him a paycheck every month his check comes from the county of
a private for-profit corporation he
enforces policy okay there are no
constitutional sheriffs in this country even the few that think they are and I've had this conversation with a lot of
them okay when it comes right down to it they must enforce policy you know who
came into the dish's County Sherriff's where we were all sitting here
114 sheriffs in that County I was one of them my wife was one of them I joined
because I wanted helped save people I wanted on the search-and-rescue team we have a lot we
have mountains in Oregon I don't know if you've ever been there they're not like these little mole hills around here you
know off my deck I can see like 11 snow-capped peaks that go up 12,000 feet
okay so people get lost in fact last
week or two they just found a hiker up on Mount Jeff that disappeared three
years ago but the snow melted enough this August that he appeared all right
three years you've been up there under that snow so most summers it doesn't
melt off okay now back for it gets like a hundred now bachelors forty minutes
from my house I can jump in the car be up there in 40 minutes I can be down here swimming in a swimming pool in 80
degree heat I can go skiing in 40 minutes 40 minutes all right so anyway
that really threw me off what's that
sheriff's okay let's hold court for a
minute who wants to be a judge
I'll pick one then all right doesn't matter yeah all you can be judges see here's the thing
you can you can stand up there is the next friend or waffle council with a
friend of yours you don't have to be a bar attorney no bar attorney is licensed
by the state they're licensed by the bar it's a labor union they're trying to
form a labor union monopoly fact we'd gun President Trump
signed an executive order asking we the people for help a couple of us took him
seriously Chris Holly anybody know Chris guy from Florida Chris Hallett he was an
attorney but a good one one that we've won over to our side right and he quit
being an attorney he's set up a company called ich laws LLC that's his law firm
but no bar members work for his law firm he helps people without being a member
of the bar and he took president Trump seriously and he wrote a brief and he
sent it to President Trump President Trump calls him up and says hey read your brief how would you like to come
speak in front of Congress and Chris said yeah okay you know turn somebody
like that down right and Chris went in front of Congress and he stood up there
and he says the Bar Association is a monopoly we do not allow monopolies in
the United States of America I would like you to collapse the monopolies but
I know most of you or bar members and since you're not going to and he looks him right in the eye and told him that
he knew they weren't going to you he says you need to open the practice up to everybody and my company cause LLC
should have the authority to stand up in court in any courtroom in the United States
that I register my company is a in that state to practice law just like
a bar attorney and guess what they signed off on it and Kirk Pendergrass
and Chris Hallett and John Gentry out of Tennessee and a few people that I know besides them I'll work for Chris Hallett
and they said go to courts as non Bar Association attorneys and so when Kirk
Pendergrass and I walked in with executive orders and slapped him on the judge's podium and said we're gonna be
helping Tim home Seth he just went uh he
couldn't think of anything to say so we talked for an hour and 20 minutes
ok yeah yeah it was and it was a sight
to behold and the people in the audience we got them all to do affidavits afterwards testifying to what they heard
and we got there we got their court transcripts because we call them out for
capital felony treason three times and it went unrebutted do you know understand what that means nobody
objected from their side they agreed so
the judge recused himself and dismissed the case now they're still after Tim but
it doesn't matter they conceded right
now we can tell her everybody because it's public record they conceded if they
concede once they're gonna get see it again now let me tell you something I went up to Washington State and I was teaching
the group about three times this size and there was a couple of judges a
couple attorneys and a couple legislators in the room and you know
what in Washington State they put a bill in front of the legislature to declare
the Bar Association a monopoly and open the practice a lot everybody
hasn't passed yet they tabled it but it
went there and it was talked about and discussed and it's been talked about and discussed two or three sessions that's
important okay well how a couple years
ago I went to Alabama and I the tenth amendment Society group group of people
just like you calling themselves the tenth amendment Society got me down there and I gave a talk just like I'm given
today pretty much and they started
learning from me and I've been sending them emails and all kinds of stuff state of Alabama is passing laws right now
Alabama is leading the pack they're gonna be the most conservative
constitutional state in the country pretty soon one of the things I talk about is our marriage licenses and the
story of a mother very important story everybody should know and I talked about
marriage licenses and what that means and what that is the US Patent and
Trademark Office and if I can assign somebody pretty soon to erase this board
so I can start over US Patent and Trademark Office the state's patent is a
marriage did you know that they patented
how they can screw you mess with you through a marriage and if you look at
the blueprint that goes along with the patent because when you're patenting a process you have to put a blueprint with
it the blueprint looks something like this hope people can see this back there
the state is the primary contract holder in the marriage
the minute you apply for the license they join with the husband which is
animal husbandry never call your spouse of your husband and never call her your
wife you're a maintenance and they
enjoin with the wife and there's nothing
that connects him nothing a dashed line
they write the word God on the dashed line any architect and any engineer will
tell you that a dashed line on the blueprint means a beam that bears no weight
they took God out of the contract he bears no weight in the contract and the
husband does not interact with the wife except through the state how do you like
them apples not very edible pretty sour and bitter
okay that's the blueprint of a marriage
so the state of Alabama I'm finishing up on this state of Alabama in my talks
that I've been doing for about the last three years I tell people how to properly get married and that is with a
family Bible cost you about the same price or less than a marriage license and you get a family Bible that has the
extra pages in the front in the back and that's where you record your family events child births marriages all those
kind of things you recorded bad daytime place who's in it who's officiating it and get a couple
witnesses who attends signature and then you take your Holy Bible with the stuff
that's written in it the event that's written in it and you take a copy of it
and you go record it at your County Courthouse now in the state of Alabama they went through this process they took
me seriously and they said the state of Alabama will no longer issue marriage licenses and that cool you get a family
Bible you record the event you take it to a probate judge in the state of Alabama and he will properly publish it
and properly record it and it is public law 97 to 80 by Congress that the Bible
is the law does it matter what religion
take the torah right
doesn't matter doesn't matter but the Bible is recognized we have freedom of
religion in this country it doesn't matter what religion okay
I've written this about a dozen times and I keep slightly changing words on it
in one of my classes there were somebody listening
his name was William Moffatt William Moffatt is a very famous name in the
United States there's been five generations of William Office and every one of them has done something
extraordinary and special but about 30 years ago
the most recent William Moffatt who's now 70 years old retired and living in
Montana started the world benefit Church and he created an organization called
voice of youth and he did it for one reason and one reason only not to have a
congregation of people that he's teaching every Sunday but to be able to go to government's all over the world
he's been to every country and spoke with every world leader for the last
thirty years and he spoke at the Hague in front of the United Nations and the
United Nations Human Rights Division and he's spoken on behalf of the children
and their families and William Moffatt
listened to one of my classes and he bugged me for about three months
thinking that I didn't have enough time on my hands and he made me an ambassador
the voice of youth and he did it because of this story and this is a story that
we all ought to know we all ought to print out we all ought to share with every man woman and child on the face of
this earth especially in the hundred and ninety seven United Nations countries
that have been under the crowning cruel okay a mother nine months pregnant and
about to deliver her precious child unknowingly walks into a foundling
Hospital a foundling hospital all hospitals in
the United States in 1908 remember I had 1908 1933 up there in 1908 it was
designated hospitals and churches as foundling hospitals what is the legal
definition word foundling it is a safe place to abandon a child
somebody can walk in with a child set it down inside of the hospital or church and walk out with no
repercussions yeah oh my right I heard
that okay family hospital one of the first acts of Congress that had to be
put in place in the United States now everything in the United States is also
in England in Canada and Australia and Ireland okay I can go on and on
it just happens at slightly different times okay I can assure you we're just
about every law in America is a law in England they usually preceded us by a
200 years to 150 years to 50 years they did it first but we've adopted it okay
the mother goes through a major medical procedure commonly known as childbirth
she is an extreme pain which means she's under duress I want you to listen
carefully the words I'm using often under the influence of painkillers just
happily looking forward to getting home with her bouncing baby when she is
brought and handed a stack of papers to sign and merely told now I've given this
speech in front of nurses before and they say that's exactly what we're taught to say merrily told that these
are just to give your baby a name and register it with the state that's exact words the nurses use when they hand the
mom of sac papers so without any full and honest disclosure of the terms and
conditions of the Security's contract without a meeting of the minds she signs
as an informant you ever looked at your birth certificates look at where the
mother signature is it's a signature of informant what is the legal definition
the word informant it is someone who gives someone else up to another police
officer it's one of the little drug dealers and catches him up on in
something and then for a little extra cash he talks me into informing on the
larger drug dealer he becomes as informant it's someone who gives someone
else up to another okay thereby under the false and fraudulent
doctrines of parens patrie that's Latin
which means the state is the parent and
in loco parentis which is Latin for crazy parenting loco was crazy crazy
parenting she unknowingly gives equitable title to
the state's Department of Human Resources is Bill Clinton signed
executive order I forget what number says Human Resources is the department
that handles human capital you're all capital human capital forever to be
known as human capital or shadow property he is slave the named vessel
named vessel a persona is regice star
I'm saying it this one on purpose star what what is registered it's a flag it's
given a flag the ship the vessel is given the flag it's registered okay it's
also given a Kusum number see u.s. IP which is an SEC regulated investment
control number and that's created a sus 2qv trust is set up under the public
charitable trust [Music]
the public Charitable Trust is an umbrella trust inside the umbrella is
all of us 320 7.2 million people Sestak
you be trusts under the public charitable trust it
says we're supposed to be the co-trustee and co beneficiary and only signatory
officer we are supposed to be the code
trustee the co beneficiary in the only signatory officer under the public
charitable trust the government holds the public charitable trust then they
did something with it such the QB Act was originally started in England in 1666 the bubonic plague was going on
they burnt half the city down to to kill the plague killing the routes they had
to rebuild nobody had a home or businesses London
was burnt and they had to rebuild so the
government came up with the cqv and slaved everybody and it created they
bonded and insured them created a monetary system based off the people's
credit their labor the only thing we truly have is our labor our works right
yes God says and they created a cess 2qv
act 1707 more company in countries adopt
adopted the susta quv Trust Act we adopted it in 1933
so all your crown countries adopted in 1777 all your Commonwealth of England
alright we adopted in 1933 Edward
Mandell house was a small group of bankers on Jekyll Island said we know how to fund government forever we can
make it the biggest largest most powerful control group system in the
world we can control the world with our suspect QP trust Act okay what does that
do it creates a balance sheet everybody
knows what a balance sheet is right debits and credits balance sheets must
balance right so on the debit side if
you were born between 1933 and 1975 the
International Monetary Fund issued six
hundred and thirty thousand dollars of Federal Reserve notes and through the
amount into the public charitable trust for you to go out and earn and collect they just printed a bunch of money a
bunch of paper six hundred thirty thousand dollars worth and various denominations and they threw it out
there to the public they also insured you for a million dollars
that's why your birth certificates on bond paper it's got a bank name on it
it's got a Kusum number at the top it's a bank actually bonded insured through
our Federal Reserve System usually the great northern bank and bonded insured
you has shuttle property $630,000
I'm a million dollar insurance policy was the collateral for them to release
the money they had to be insured the IMF
ain't that dumb right they wanted their money insured we're gonna release six hundred thirty thousand we won't be
insured some reason I keep saying that on the credit side six hundred and
thirty thousand dollars worth of United States Treasury bonds are sold under the
Kusum number as an investment account guess what it balanced and this is
insured in 1975 the amounts were
increased to 1 million and two million now guess what you think that's the end
of it you also want out got a social security number they did the same thing Social
Security numbers acoustic number you got a driver's license so Kusum number a
military ID Kusum number your advanced degree in college your student ID number as you
improve in life they think you're worth more money so they bond you and insure you again and again and again and they
tie all those future Kusum numbers back to the original birth number
they're all linked not that I know I'll
just say it that way okay Kusum numbers
debits credits alone this is a loan from
the IMF this is the United States
Treasury issuing bonds what are bonds the Full Faith and Credit of the United
States government you all your labor so
guess what what else is a Kusum number court cases
yeah yeah I've heard this at federal court in the ninth district okay I
showed where all crimes are commerce all
crimes are commerce
you get arrested on a felony count of fraud two million dollars is taken from
your success the Kyuubi trust by the court for one count two million per
count at four counts of fraud that's eight million bucks so much that Court
gives the judge gets ninety five thousand dollars in net retentions I
prove this in federal court that retentions that's a polite way of saying
commission the prosecuting attorney is
fifty thousand this is a judge
prosecutor now you have one defense attorney person defending you do you
know the judge and the prosecutor chip in they give him out of their share
that's supposed to be a four but I can't write upside down
twenty thousand each
now you and I'm using an actual case paid your defense attorney $27,000 you
wrote him a check to defend you but on the back end
he gets $40,000 if you're convicted
whose side is he on right
it's called railroading to lead someone down a narrow path or rail to a
predetermined outcome or conclusion I can read almost every court transcript
in this country and show you the fraud of railroading because I know how to
read the court transcripts I can see where people's motions have been denied their witnesses have been denied their
legal documents have been ignored they're not properly defended or
defending themselves or their defense attorney is sitting on his tough and
trying to be nice here because normally I'd cuss at that point because I get
irritated mad at this and not objective
is not repudiated he's not objecting to
anything the prosecutor says so you pay
him to sit there and if you say hey how come you didn't judge he says not right
now we'll have our turn see his job is an actor - a turn I'll get to you in
just said an actor - a turn is to get up on stage and act convincingly enough to
make you believe in the plot and the character that he's playing so he's acting as your buddy your
defense attorney your best friend and he's making you believe by his
performance that he is not attorney you
when he is attorney you what was the definition of a turn to steal from one
and turn over to another he stole your wife because for one to kill a felony
counter fraud that's worked to millions of court you go to jail for five years for four you got 20 years are you mad
yet see if my job really here is to piss you off because if you guys don't get
pissed off of what I'm saying then you're not gonna do anything about it you're gonna go home watch TV and watch the Razorbacks and yeah you're
gonna go back to your daily life on Monday go to work until you get darn
good and mad maybe you'll start doing something about it and I ain't here for my breath I'm here
to teach the teachers I'm gonna go
fishing someday I'm not gonna be doing this eight City at month thing and not
even living a life at all and I've been doing this a long time and I'm getting
tired I love you guys I keep doing it probably till the day I die I'm not joking but at some point time I might
die I almost didn't March I'll tell you that story in a little while but your
job is to take the simplicity of the knowledge zone giving you where you can
sit down with a husband and wife in a restaurant on the back of a napkin and you could draw some of these little
descriptions like this and you can tell them about the public charitable trust and about where power comes from in this
nation and about authority and you can give them you can piss them off so
they'll do something about it it has to be simple it has to be
duplicatable it can't be too complicated we don't need to know about every writ
of habeas corpus and writ of mandamus and ararat coram nobis and go on and on and on okay we don't have
to know that what we need to do is we need to go out and get a whole bunch of people pissed off and I'm serious we
have to because until they're good and mad about the things that are happening
to them and their lies what about foreclosures what about your kids being
taken your grandkids being taken without any due process of law both laws that
set up Child Protective Services title four and a spa say in the law that they
cannot take your children from you without your consent they can't do it
except for one exception if you have been charged tried found guilty and
sentenced and proper due process of law to a felony then they can come take your
kid while you're in jail and they must place it with a family member first if
there's no family members who will step up to the plate then they can put it in a foster home
because somebody's got to take care of kids by foster two of them okay
proper due process a lot must be followed your first go ahead no that's
your defense attorney and it depends on the charge it's called a penal some and they put it all right I'm gonna answer
this question because it's real important I was gonna do it tomorrow but we'll do it today and I won't have to do
it tomorrow I hope so cuz I'm telling you you're not
pissed off you're not gonna do anything I'm sorry you'll go home and watch TV you'll get caught up in soap operas or
whatever alright well it was a new one uh my wife watches oh the the guys who run the
obstacle courses yeah that's it see I don't watch TV it's a waste of time
and I'll watch sports either those were designed by the Romans to distract us so
the Romans could steal everything that people had and our country's doing the same thing all right a penal son
the federal government the district postal courts of the government the
court clerk is the head banker the head court clerk at every federal district
court is the head banker most people think it's a judge no no it's the court
clerk Mary in Portland Oregon at the 9th district Federal Court which is 7 States
by the way their headquarters is in Portland Oregon Mary judge Moseman is a
head judge over all the other judges but Mary controls the books okay and she
goes online with the Department of
fiscal services who are they oops who
are they they're the counts for the United States Treasury
that's the accounting department of the United States Treasury they keep track of everything fiscal okay
and Mary upon indictment fills out an SF
273 form which is a bid bond form upon
indictment what is an indictment an indictment is a true bill they're giving
you an invoice you have just been indicted here's your bill that's what
they did and how many people are smart enough to go well how much is the bill
how much is it well the Penal some you've been charged with us for account of fraud is two
million dollars oh crap I can't pay that bill I just don't have it right but
that's what the indictment would say if they disclose the money because that's
the Penal sum this is the Penal sum for
that particular crime of fraud that's how much the bill is on your indictment
but you can't pay the bill and you didn't ask bothered to ask how much it
was anyway so they bring you up on charges
if you campaign to charges you're asked to bond if you can't pay the bond your body is held as surety while they steal
from your sister TV Trust so in order to steal from your chefs 2qb Trust she's
got to do a bid bond a bid bond says this person has been indicted and there's a penal sum of two million
dollars on that we're gonna put in a bid bond and on the bid bond it's gonna show
here's what a bid bond is let me explain what a bid bond us first before I go in more into what's going to show a bid
bond is telling the United States Treasury that this person with this
custom number that's tied to the birth certificate custom number because here's our court case number so now a custom
number it's tied to the birth certificate number the bid bond
is an order to begin liquidation of
funds you got to remember what's inside your says to QV trust United States
Treasury bonds that is not liquid capital you can't wipe it out of your pocket and go spend it right now it's
got to be sold so it's an order to the
Treasury to begin to sell your BA your
US Treasury bonds starts element create
some liquid capital so that what we ask for it and we ask for the wire transfer you'll
have it available that's what it is now
guess what on the bid bond sheet is a settlement date not only is it a
settlement date but there's another date on there so there's a date to begin to
sell there's a date on there that says by this date we're hoping you'll have
the penal some available and by this date is the date we expect to settle the
account three days on us up to 73 that
is done upon indictment now understand why I'm saying this and emphasizing it you haven't been tried yet you haven't
been found guilty you haven't been sentenced right guess
what this date is it will correspond to your sentencing date this will
correspond to your trial date
you haven't even been notified of your trial date yet much less your sentencing
day this is a Pawnee diamond is this railroad E is this a predetermined
outcome or conclusion I don't know you tell me upon trial a SF 274 for
performance bond as saying hey we just
found the guy guilty you're gonna have to perform Treasury that's what he does
notify him that you better have that penal some ready because you're gonna have to perform
you go to sentencing you get thrown in jail because your body is now held as
surety for the bond and she fills out the SF 275 for that's a payment bond you
know what that is it is a wire transfer
order and within if courts sentencing is
held at nine o'clock in the morning which they try and do they will get paid by five if it's later in the day they'll
get paid the following day direct wire transfer between the Treasury Department
and the court the federal court now on the state level
looks a little similar doesn't it but this is out of the instead of the
Department of fiscal services this is actually out of the GSA so state you go
into state court court clerk fills out the same kind of a form only on paper
and guess what they sell it to the
federal court all our courts sell to the
federal court the court buys the CUSIP numbers which were bonded and insured
and they pay the state courts through
the GSA SF 23 24 25 a form bid bond paid
performance bond and payment bond same exactly all the federal government did
it's out of the two in front of it well no they didn't they out of the seven in
the middle what am I thinking I'm not don't listen to me
no that's all they did Saturday to no.7
thank you sure yeah no look up your court if
you've got a court case coming up who is your enemy they're a private for-profit business
owned by whom how many important no no no they're not
they're just like a McDonald's franchise the government sold every branch of
government off that's right some roam by
judges well what would happen if they found out your head judge in your County
Courthouse on the courthouse and that supposed to be a public building see
remember what I said there are two of everything there's a United States of
America that is your government that lives inside each one of us the president Trump through executive order
admitted and restored okay and then
there's a United States corporation to separate animals there's the state of
Arkansas which is a corporation and there's Arkansas a dizzier government
whose seats are vacant okay what were
the common law offices that they could never get rid of technically there's two
and a half of them left and the reason I say half is the half as the Sheriff's
Department the share RIF only one of them right he's half because he's
getting paid by the enemy and he's trying to be a de jure government so he's under conflict and one cannot serve
two masters okay then you have justices of the peace and notary republics look
at your notary forms very carefully your notary forms can say state of Arkansas
or they can say Arkansas state they can say County of what was it
County of Washington or they can say Washington County they can say notary or they can say
notary Republic make sure you're using notary forms that describe the
jurisdiction that you're in because otherwise you can walk in with the best sovereign document into a court being in
common law and have the wrong notary form and the judge goes ha ha ha ha I'm
not gonna tell you why but you're mine buddy right there's both a lot of them
say notary yes notary public notary
public not repo yes notary publics that's a common law
office officer if you take your notary public and you say as duritz certificate
and then Arkansas State and Washington
County and you autograph it on the right hand side by now you've got a common law
document who's an officer of the court so it's already accepted by the court
the second the notary signed it most
people don't know that so you'd need their documents all go ahead
franchises what if McDonald's bought burger key and then Burger King bought
Wendy's see just subsidiary corporations
states which are all your counties included work out of the DSA and the
federal works out of the Department of fiscal services it's all the same stuff and it's also sold to the feds what's
that they don't even register their
their corporations except in DC I'll bet
you the state of Arkansas has an address at 444 West Washington Boulevard Washington DC
ok North Capitol ok yeah they have different addresses every every state
corporation is registered in DC as a subsidiary guess what so is the United
States it's registered under the District of Columbia which is registered under the crown Inc how do you like them
apples go to the department fiscal
services website and pull up the blanks see the average American doesn't go to
the Department of fiscal services website for anything it is designed for
court clerk's to go to the Department of fiscal services website and they ask
questions and you can learn a lot by the questions and answers it'll show the questions if you click on them and you
don't know to do this but if you click on them it'll pull the answer up of the Department fiscal services answering the
court clerks like what do you do with a case whose value is more than a hundred
million dollars and the department of services when you click on it cuz Mary
asked that question during the Bundy trials their case was valued at more than a hundred million dollars that's
how much the court would have got yeah and guess what well I was on the Rhine
Bunny's legal team and Shawna Cox's legal team and we got butt off okay
wasn't the darn attorneys that did it it was Shawna Cox is Ryan Bundy who got
them all off you got to understand that okay so why because we fired their
attorney we filed documents in court three times answering the rule 3 C Ryan
Bundy he would carry his Bible and he was carried his Constitution into the
courtroom and the u.s. marshals would confiscated at the door and he asked the
judge one time how come I can't bring my Bible in the Constitution in the court she said you're not a party to it
well that pissed me off so I came into the picture with that comment and I said
enough is enough Ryan we're gonna make it an American stay national we're gonna file in the
county of your birth we're gonna send it to the Secretary of State we're gonna do a patent an activity on you we're gonna do a deed a reconveyance all your names
and every which way shape and form and we're gonna get it done right now and then I'm gonna start filing documents in your court case Ryan says okay let's do
it and he sat in jail for a while and he
was tortured we dinner a document I knew that rule three hadn't happened he's going well
how come the document didn't work on it give him some time I know this process
file another one oh shoot filed two now and now start people from the outside
are starting to attack us right you're screwing everything I said I just shut
up don't listen to him we file another document all three of them said about the same thing we just
said it in three different ways and we established its status his standing
challenge their jurisdiction we pointed out the fraud guess what there's no
statute of limitations on fraud and jurisdiction right and we pointed it out
and so as soon as we got that third document filed I said Ryan Monday morning when you've got the court
hearing again here's what I want you to do I said I want you to stuff some toilet paper in the bottom of your pocket the word there's orange jumpsuit
suits with one pocket right sticks of toilet paper in the bottom because I want that Constitution sticking up as
far as it can possibly stick up and walk into the courtroom and watch what
happens and he walks in and u.s. marshals smile on him shake his hand
they know this stuff and the other attorneys for the other guys and they
only want ones that went to jail we're the ones that sign plea deals by the way everybody else went home the ones that
refuse a sign and he walks in and nobody
took his constitutional and he sat down and he watched the attorneys of the
other guys question a federal witness most of the day he just sat there and
they say the last one got done and told the judge the defense rests
and the judge looks over at Ryan and it says Ryan and she smiled real big and
she's a writer would you like to question the other witness Ryan hadn't been allowed to talk since the very
first hearing every time we went to a hearing he couldn't talk and Nelson the
judges asked him if he wants to question the federal witness shocked him to the
core but he said yes I do and he walks up to the witness and he says how long
have you been a federal officer and the guy said twenty-two years and Ryan says when you took office did
you swear an oath to the Constitution and he says yes I did
and Ryan gets all cocky and he says well have you read it and the guy says no and
so for three and a half hours Ryan went through the Constitution with them and questioned him and asked him and
corrected his answers when they were wrong until they agreed finally Ryan
said I'm all done with this witness and they left and they all went back to jail
it went in half an hour over till 5:30 and they closed the fire and there were
religious about that and it went a half an hour over Thursday after the Monday
of that hearing that came back for a hearing and the case was dismissed and
everybody thought it was the Wooten memo well let me tell you how DOMA that
statement is the Wu memo was already brought up in motion it was denied they
couldn't bring it up but some senator from the state of Washington got a whole Luton memo and putting on national TV
and everybody thought the wooden memo is the reason the case was dismissed I'm
here to tell you right now is because Ryan established a status standing his jurisdiction and he was able to talk
about the Constitution and from that moment on it was a constitutional court
of record with a summary judgment that's
simple that's simple
well right now they're used against you
prior to 1999 we could get a few things paid off with our bonds most people
since then who state that are lying to you or they end up in jail for fraud and doing it why because the country went
through another bankruptcy in 1999 and they went through another one in 2011
this country just keeps going into bankruptcy changing little tiny things
and then they hold the dead the courts
collect off this system a trillion dollars a day I wasn't going to tell you
that because it shocks people to core trillion dollars a day that's more in 25
days than our entire gross domestic product of the United States where is
the money in this country it's in the bond market it's not backed by gold and
silver no it's backed by your labor you are the Full Faith and Credit of the
United States government all under that umbrella of the public Charitable Trusts
all sets the QB trusts are the Full Faith and Credit of the United States government all three hundred and twenty seven point two million people however
the majority of them all live in Washington DC like you all and the
reason I'm telling you that is if you haven't repudiated your citizenship with
the Secretary of State as title 8 section 1101 a 21 a state national the
only one with limited diplomatic immunity ask for the Geneva Convention you status is in Washington DC because
of the sure way you write your address on your mail if you put a zip code on your mail you're in the district of the
District Columbia and you just reside as a resident in Arkansas temporarily to do business
because that's the definition of the word resident someone there temporarily to do business see I'm a people a man a
living soul of son of God and inhabitant
mm-hmm no I won't be a citizen of anything it but got perverted and it's
also with the wall lower sea and all of
our the United States documentation it's a large sea and then it got perverted
city means municipal Zen means society we were supposed to be members of
society but they changed the definition to municipal instead of member got
perverted now we can't be a citizen of anything your state national urine
Arkansas yeah I was gonna do that
tomorrow but yeah I remember
mmm-hmm what's the Constitution say says to be safe in your papers and your
affect your passport is your papers and
your affect that the Constitution understand what a constitution is it's a compact We the People
lay down law how many people have read the law of nations by Battelle besides
him what 1 2 3 3 4 people have read the
law of nations that is the first
international law document ever written for international law that's how nations were founded how nations were set up
197 over the last count so far 14 of them backed out in Zurich in July when I
was there I got I got 14 sovereign nations to sign a pact in Zurich what
last month July not last month we're in September month before last I was track
yeah 14 sovereign nations so far I'm working on it David tomorrow we're gonna
talk about a passport state national versus state citizens so you all can be aware that that's gonna be answered
directly correct if I don't remind me you will okay it's hard to cover
everything in a short period of time and I'm also I believe it or not as much as
I've showed you already I'm trying to keep it very simple and duplicatable we
can make this very complicated I'm saying don't god I hate that word I hate
that word template yes I have 350,000
documents on this computer and then some probably another 10,000 books on there
so yeah there's templates for everything god I hate that word forms and templates
those are the downfall never fill out a government form who wrote forms
attorneys attorneys control government they control the legislature they have
usurped every branch of government Trump and all the goodly tries to do while
he's being beat to death he has to run to attorneys to see if it's okay or he
does it and then it goes to attorneys and they either overrule him or they don't but attorneys bar members
control every branch of government we're supposed to have four branches of government right
no five people are freaking out right now five we the people are the first branch
of government we're it we the people laid down the law it's that simple
that in which we the people create we control maximum law that in which one
creates one controls and how come they're controlling you because they
created the US citizen the Thirteenth Amendment the Constitution freed the
black slaves of the 14th amendment Constitution made you all slaves and created the US citizen the person the
resident the ten districts they expanded
the ten square miles of Washington DC all across the United States into ten
districts of the District of Columbia you don't believe me go to the state of
Arkansas and get a federal indictment and where are you tried you're tried in
the what district is this 8th district of the District of Columbia you're not
trying Arkansas you might think you are cuz you walk in the building somewhere on the map but you're tried in the
District of Columbia in a federal court why because you use your zip code on
something you said I'm a citizen you check the box when you got your driver's
license your social security number your your passport your voter ID whatever you
check some darn box you know you you committed a felony when you did that it
is illegal according to the United States code to claim to be a citizen when you are not and you did not go
through the steps necessary and we produce in court too there are certain steps necessary to become a citizen if
somebody comes from X Co or Canada they want to be a citizen of the United States they have to go
through certain steps to become a system you have to follow those steps another you did it you're just claiming to be
and they let you get away without felony because that's what they want you to be because then you're in their control
yeah I feel like I'm the only free
person in the country sometimes right
what's that it's just being an American
stay national in title eight section 1101 is your definitions of status and
you each and every one of you have the unalienable right of self-determination
something nobody no government can take away from you god gave you the free agency he gave you
dominion over the land air and water okay which is the law jurisdictions okay
land air and water I told that right no oh my gosh where am
I that was last night that's what's messed me up you know that
right okay in Genesis 1:26 or 28 God gave me man
dominion over the land the air and the water and everything therein it's his
it's not mine I am the steward the ambassador I do his
work and I'm there to take good care of it that's what I'm charged with but he
also did something else he gave us free agency the right of self-determination to determine what was best and sometimes
we're screw-ups and we make mistakes right but that's how we'll be judged the
land and by the way the Vatican confirmed all this starting in 1455 with the first
three testamentary trusts signed over an 81 year period setting aside they didn't
set aside nothing God already gave it to us in the Bible all they did is confirmed it okay and then I'm gonna say
that about the Constitution about the anything yeah Constitution didn't give us any rights we already have also did
is confirmed our rights the jurisdiction
of the land the air and the water and this is law but I started in the
beginning I don't know how I got off track but I said we were gonna hold court who wants to be the judge remember
that this is why I've asked probably
close to 300 judges and prosecutors this question what is the law worded its
origins come from how did we arrive at this thing called law where a small group of men could put something down on
paper and hold me a man accountable and then I shut up I'll let him answer and
they screw it all up they get it wrong every time most of them are
compartmentalize legal idiots and they don't know and that's what we all are
we're all compartmentalize illegal it is in every job we do and everything we do
because we don't know the big picture we're compartmentalize see if I a conman
and I want to pull off a con job and I want to rip off a million people and I got to hire a hundred people to help me
do that if I told them what the con was it all quit why because people are
basically good honest and moral people so what do I do I need them to help me i
compartmentalize yours again away driver and you break down the door and you hit
the ball and you watch the people whatever I'm using those stupid examples
but you compartmentalize well that's our county clerks and our real estate agents and our cartographers
and our our appraisers and our mortgage brokers and our court clerk's and that's
how they steal your house from you on behalf of the state you put them all together as a conspiracy to defraud and
I can prove it it's also in another realm it's our police officers and our prosecutors and
our defense attorneys and our judges and our court clerk's and they do a
conspiracy to defraud and I can prove it and I want to pull off a con job I just
got to compartmentalize everybody and then I can go rip them off and rip off
millions of people and a small group of greedy papers ran counselled by Edward
Mandell house on Jekyll Island set up this whole plot based upon little things
England did years before because Mandal house studied it he didn't just make it
up one day okay he followed the leader but he was smart enough to put all the
pieces of the puzzle together so the government hides everything in plain sight everything everything is in print it's
all hidden in plain sight they just don't put it in one book they put this little piece of the puzzle in
this book in this law and this little piece in this law and they put it up this guy is like me who read it all
study it all put the pieces of the puzzle together try and reduce it down to the simplest so I can teach you
that's it they make this stuff up not my wildest dreams could I thought of this I
had to learn it alright so got off track
I didn't even finish the story of a mother that's terrible
land air and water the land is common-law anybody see what
I did with my pen now I want to tell you
something the air is higher than the land and you have to go into the water you're gonna drown and die it's that simple
the land is common law common to all mankind set aside by the first
testamentary trust of 1455 with the trustee given to King Ferdinand of Spain
King Ferdinand was in charge of all the land in the world so you built the fleet
of ships to go collect his treasure and we'll talk some about that to Tom and
all mankind it is property rights
property how did I do this and equity
rights property and equity the
jurisdiction the air is ecclesiastical or canon law which is trust law the
water is Admiralty or Commerce which is
contract law
that's it that is our three jurisdictions
Juris means right law what are those three right law that
we're talking about that we're standing under that we're in this situation juris
diction means words you look words up in the dictionary the words you use
determines the right law under which you
stand land air or water so one mr. prosecutor a minute ago misused the word
jurisdiction on purpose to confuse his general public and everyone else in this courtroom when he said it was in the
county's jurisdiction what he really meant to say was locusts or venue
location or venue it's in the counties have been you why because doesn't matter
if you're in the city the county the state the federal government this agency or that agency they all operate in one
jurisdiction contract law we the people
can create a private trust and we can operate in ecclesiastical or canon law
we the people can not harm our neighbor love thy neighbor and do no harm you can
break no other law and we would be in common law we can have a land patent and
we can not go into foreclosure or see if you're going into foreclosure it's because of a contract and it's because
they stole your property probably before you even bought it and definitely the
day you bought it you haven't owned a house and your whole life plus you hold
on land patent all property shall be in land patent all property shall be
described in boots and bounds not walk 27 the block 3 of Spring Hill subdivision fit bill Arkansas what did I
just say I said the county cartographer and the county appraiser in the county
tax assessor we described your property as commercial industrial or residential
property which are all commercial terms and stoled your private property from you by Reed ascribing your property as a
lot 27 a block 3 of Spring Hill subdivision pet bill Arkansas and they
took the land patent number off of your invoice and they put a lot blocking tax
number on there and they put your person name and your address with it in the District of Columbia and they made all
manner of errors and they sent it to you as a tax statement which is an invoice
and you looked at the invoice and you wrote him a check and you paid it so you agreed to the contract and you a query
honest and they stole your property in fact until it wasn't until I owned a real estate company two mortgage
companies in a title company and two land development companies and I had a
construction company and a specialty building supply company all the same time and I was running all these
companies that I learned that at idle officer when a husband and wife comes in
to sign their mortgage documents and they get all done the title officer is trained to say and how would you like
the whole title and you look at each other and you say I don't know what are
our options and she says well most husbands a wife's whole title and joint tenants in common and you look at each
other and you go hmm husband wife gee that's joining yeah okay sounds good join his husband or
wife tennis is renter common estate joint renters to the state
jeez that's how you hold title and then you get foreclosed on you wonder why you could walk into court with all the
perfect fraud you want on the look on the mortgage company and the mortgage broker and the judge rules for who the
mortgage company or the mortgage broker against you because he doesn't want to
tell you you didn't know your property in the first place I don't know slap
yourself say you were stupid and call today no I'm I'm just saying that's what happens right we didn't know any better
it's not our fault somebody is some land
patent it's private property it's already there all properties are hid in
land patent I just looked one up in Pennsylvania for a guy and helped him file his land patent and it was land
patent number 402 signed by James Madison the four hundred second land
patent issued in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States what
was in the state of Pennsylvania gosh
the eleventh hour and 55th minute it's a good time so there's an underlying land
patent its land patent number 23 47 a part and parcel thereof described as
from the from this Township and this rage yeah meet some Mouse 497 feet to
this corner and whatever right you put the meat some balance subscription not a
description that says a lot 27 a block 3a Spring Hill subdivision Fayetteville Arkansas ah yeah you see and they don't
even use Arkansas they use a K or a AR AR I was in Alaska for a minute okay you
see what I mean they make all kinds of errors see we only have two jobs we only
have two jobs in life one is to the errors our public servants make and the other is to educate them so they
never do it again unfortunately those are full-time jobs nope go to the
cartographers office somewhere go to the title company's office go to go go to
your county land record somewhere there became an abstractive title what's that
everything is an abstract now a warranty deed is an abstracted title oh you're
you're you're talking about not abstracts yeah what they're using now is abstracts see a land patent has to have
a grant DT is their successors and or of science anything from the dirt down is
the land everything that's an improvement is real-estate so a
real-estate come in agent comes in and lists your property he's selling
everything from or he or she is selling everything from the ground up and just given the land away under some kind of
abstract of title did you know that yeah here I got this great piece of dirt over
here and they're selling me the improvements that's what a real estate
contract is real estate is the improvements it's an estate it's the air
you can't have an estate on something God created he can give us dominion over
that and we can be good stewards of that but it ain't inherited to me the
stewardship is what's inherited his heir successors and or assigns real estate is
sold land pounds can't be sold they must be granted that's why a grant deed a
grant deed is the only real deed everything else Oh a quick claim a
warranty deed those are all abstracts of title see and we wonder why our house gets
foreclosed on I lost nine million in real estate between 2008 and 2010 I gave
most of it back to the banks if I would
have known that then now I have three pieces of property and they're all under land pest we're gonna talk processes
tomorrow I'm trying to give you some basic education as much as I give in a
short period of time to try and teach you to be teachers to talk to people in
simplicity now I know I've covered a lot of crap today and that doesn't seem
right now on your brain because your brains are starting to go through that
it's simple but believe me this is about a simple crayon as I could get all right
and this this is the issue so we're holding court there's three types of law
three juris now there's diction
that determines which Juris you're in let me say two sentences both sentences
are going to mean the same thing going down a road in a car okay
first sentence is as a free man I could
travel and private upon the highways with nothing but my passport as my
papers and my protection and I am waffle
pay attention the words the diction second sentence as a citizen I can drive
or operate a motor vehicle with my driver's license insurance registration
upon the roadways as long as I'm following all the statutes I am legal
see if I walked into a Chevy dealership I happen to like Chevy's and I Drive Chevy Silverado pickups at home.how five
of them used to have 26 that's another story
and if I walk into a Chevy dealership and I want to buy a brand new Chevy Silverado and I without $70,000 and I
set it on the desk do all the paperwork
you'll say great salesperson smiling he's gonna make a good Commission that
day I'm happy I've got my brand new truck and then he says something to me
that makes me mad he says I need another $185 for a license title and
registration and I get out and I write him a check and I hand him the $185
check I just gave the state of Oregon my $70,000 truck as a gift one that nice to
me now they're going to give me a certificate of title back that's going
to give me the opportunity to make a profit or in cure a loss in the lease of
that vehicle that's how what it says in the law an
opportunity to make a profit or incur a loss in the lease of that vehicle but
the state owns it they've got the manufacturer's statement of origin or if
you drive a BMW a Porsche Bauval from a European it's a
manufacturer certificate of origin MCO or esse MSO and the state owns that and
the state holds on to it and they give you a certificate of title which is an
abstract of title okay I just did that
with your gold and silver between 1933 and 1935 - under the fine or
imprisonment of ten thousand dollars yeah my grandfather was a geologist for the
state of California he gave over a million dollars worth of gold surrender this right right that's
why I have some silver right here people say hey you don't use the real money I say yes I do
he's got the Liberty Bell right there that's my Liberty
but that's the issue we operate off Federal Reserve notes which is legal
tender it does not pay off or discharge a debt it tenders it to a later date
remember when I was doing the balance sheet sure the one into this a little more in depth but I keep thinking I'm
gonna run out of time all right so I don't cover everything as thoroughly as I wish I could because
we'd be here awhile but it tenders it to a later date they keep track of it
through your bank statements and your tax returns everything that you spend
see the story of a mother when you reach 18 your job is to go out there in the
world gather up as much as that Federal Reserve Note loaned that the IMF gave as
you can and then go out and spend it and all that thing you bought a $200,000
house and $70,000 Chevy Silverado and fifty thousand dollars worth of utilities over your lifetime and it's
all kept track up through your bank statements every time you that's why you
have to have a social security number a n number or ti n number to open a bank account because they report to the
Federal Reserve they keep track of your system you trust all your debit side everything you spend everything you make
all right some of these doctors that go out and
make 2 million a year or more their cqv is worth billions of dollars because
they just keep this under more custom numbers this guy's good I'm just gonna invest in him I'll buy some more bonds and reinsure him and give him another
custom number he doesn't know about and if the government's not getting enough
money out of the trillion dollars of a day they take out of the court system in the United States the Department of
fiscal services tells you that the Department of Justice is the largest contributor the federal budget by far so
here's something I did last night I drew a little circle with a little pie and I
said this is our taxes and this is the federal government's budget and then we got a little bit more on
tariffs and that's grown because of Trump these are tariffs and these are taxes
tax and tear right where's all this
money come from
Department of fiscal services will tell you the Department of Justice is the biggest contributor the federal budget by far one trillion a day and we think
our taxes by roads now your gas tax by heroes every time together pump roads
our highways their postal roads they're free we support them with our gas that
we purchase say that we ask the federal
government we the people ask the federal government to provide us with 19 essential governmental services and no
more and the and no more I feel for you that's hard sitting this long I
understand your pain okay 19 essential governmental services and
no more that's the contract we signed called compound that we went through our
states as state nationals we the people and the states got together and signed
the Constitution the compact or contract with the federal government asking the
federal government to provide 19 essential governmental services and no
more that's the most important part and no more how many they provide us with today oh man and they forces a gunpoint
to pay for it right no free phones all
kinds of services privileges they provide who wants a privilege every time
you get a privilege you give up a right I'd rather have my rights and my
privileges I don't want any privileges okay
we talked a little bit about these guys one thing i want you to know is one of the greatest wars going on in the world
today is going on inside this group it's very important to know this
get all those horses fed sorry i did and dogs and puppies
wow [Music]
so one of the greatest wars is going inside of this spirit right now
god told us that one-third of those that happened that's one out of
in three group it's being divided right now so let's
just call this one third two thirds
it was all equal for a long period of time the evil rose to the top and it was only the vatican backed out
from the midnight when they backed out of the pindar and they went on the queen of holland this man jumped
in his place this man's been fairly good honest righteous man
and now he's written letters to these people saying hey we need to knock this
off you gotta stop it and a lot of the ones were joining and this line
is a
believe it or not the queen joined him now it's two-thirds one
pretty darn special pretty interesting so president trump on the universe was
supposed to go to the process i was supposed to be there representing some sovereign
governments they were supposed to sign something called the global currency reset
and it never happened it didn't happen because he had an opportunity a small
window that he didn't see the point
and basically this man is a cousin of donald trump yesterday we
were talking about hierarchy and how genealogy works through the world
all of our presence can be traced back to king jonas of spain of england except
for two one traces to both and one traces
to king burton remember what i told you yesterday
now war going on inside this group has moved it's changing it's becoming more and more righteous with this group
if it even becomes two-thirds the whole world is going to change for the better
another thing we talked about this morning you draw a circle
and you could write any group you want inside that circle there's a great wall of
china built right now through the middle of it never want to complain about any organization
being all that all evil because it's not true
about half the people in each organization are the best and the best of the brightest in the world and
they've saved the world many many many times over i'm talking about individuals one man
who's allowing you to sit here today because he did something that's safe
and i can tell you story after support okay on the other side is border
followers
too many people out there fuel hate doesn't feel
hate they get mad and they complain about one organization if you're going to complain about one
there's only two or two that i can think of that you have
any cause to really complain about vanessa bar
the fbi and the bankers the fbi has no lawful
but for the vast majority they had a purpose they were set up and designed for one purpose and one
purpose only and that was to protect the state the fbi
was created in 1908 by secretary of the department of justice
they have no congressional authority to even exist no congressional charter when they asked
congress for a formal charter they were denied
they were denied by congress to have any of the work yet they exist so how do they operate
how do they have authority through their power and belief they
dress in nice citizens they show up in the police office and they're all they're all tough and they can out out
debate most police chiefs see and they can presume that they have
the authority we are the fbi we always get our man you know they just
they just command the authority and then the voice chief's consent
and when they show up at your door we're here from the fbi you quiver and you just start to shrink
and you give them your consent and you answer their questions and you give them your authority
if i'm tired and exhausted and i don't want to deal with life anymore and i walk up to the security guard in a
shopping mall and i say hey buddy i'm tired i don't want to make any more decisions i'm just
going to give you all my authority you tell me where to go what to do where to eat where is it it doesn't matter
you tell them he he now has the same authority as
happier the security guard has shot people over you
because you gave it this is what we have to realize what i'm trying to drop
into your heads is all authority in government today is perceived
it's perceived authority by you they have no legal authority they're
private for-profit entities that are all defacto
they're not desired they're all operating without that through the consent of the government
what it's supreme court cases there's hundreds of them
rules go statutes and ordinances turn on law they're corporate bylaws the
governments operate through the consent of the government title 18 241 of 242
241 is a conspiracy to deprive you of your rights under the color law
242 is the deprivation of rising earthquake one that just means whether there's one or
more people when we start realizing this when we
wake up and we learn that their perceived authority
that's when we begin to see we have the power and not them so we want to change the
country remember we're right we're 700 all 730 days in entire 2000 days of
awakening the country is waking up people are waking up all over the nation
they're standing up they're going to their legislator they're going to the president they're speaking in front of congress
they're they're protesting the hospitals they're protesting the
whatever might be cps agencies okay and people are waking up all over
the nation because they're starting to realize they're just perceived at the word
what's that oh yeah go ahead and say it one more time it's the people who have woken or who
are naturally awoken whatever who
they get covertly you know
i have to that was god i have to do it again
three things again always keep in mind they get your tasks
in agreement if you're a citizen person or resident they can do whatever they want
and then how to get that test
here here's how a cop's trained to get it in 30 seconds and i'll tell you how
police officer pulls you over you roll your window down he walks in the window says can i have your charge listen for
the insurance registration please sure officer you gather them all at the end
you just gave him to the agreement being a citizen okay because you're from a citizen
employee yeah municipal leader employee
okay so you're an employee of government right there you've got tests then the driver's license confirms
arrest your all cap's name is on there your your address is on there with your
set resident is someone there temporarily to do business living in washington dc but residing in
whatever state you're in temporarily to do business and kind of put it on the
dash or somewhere it's outrageous why do i do that it shows my intent
to protect my neighbor i don't verify it i'll give it to him i
will let him know i have the intent that i care about my name see if you love your neighbor do no harm
you can't break any lungs you can't that's it that's the only two
laws you've got to fall off that neighborhood
so they give you your tax degree they use these two doctors to steal
everything from
who asked me when class was over yesterday about the penal sums and how do you burn that
in case anyway
it's not easy to produce this takes a lot of time and research
if you have a federal case it's much easier so if you're charged with a federal crime it's easier to prove
than it is a state crime as the state hides it through the gsas it's a lot more difficult but on the
federal level you can pull up your pacer you can see the things it says you can
compare that to the department of fiscal services you can compare the dates on your your indictments and your your
trials and your sentencing dates with the days on department business services and on
fidelity.com you can pull up all three screens and you can figure it out how much how much they're getting
everything this one when he got in trouble they had him in
state and federal and states with my case we have the same state versus the
federal lending statement federal and then one state in the state of the state that's
highly unusual yes because they have no saying you're looking at 20 years here
and then they said that it was six years of statement yeah
if they even mention that something like that to you yeah but if they do and you know if they
ever mention oh you're looking at 12 years say oh no i'm not looking at any time at all he
says time don't matter and let him know that let him know why it doesn't matter
because you're declaring your innocence you always declare your innocence you're
not guilty or not guilty you're innocent
you keep declaring your innocence in your court case every document you put in to clear your innocence
in order for a crime to be committed there's got to be intent
and that's why i show them the insurance card put it in the middle it's my intent not
to harm my neighbors
that's it everything is about intent how many times has somebody gone to
trial and the prosecutor got up there and just
railroaded you through and not one single person said you had intent to commit the crimes
i've seen entire federal cases go through trial and people found guilty
and i read all the transcripts i see what happened i look at all their documents in the case
i can see they've been railroaded and i can see that not one person asks for
the intent so i write a little note to the judge a little notice and suggestion
where was the intent proven that this person had any intent to
commit crime holy
prosecutor how come you didn't prove it and the judge jumps onto your side
and go starts going after the prosecutor it's fun to watch it's really fun bring
that up sometime watch what happens really interesting
okay land air water three different types of
law property equity rights trust or contract those are our three jurists we need to
know the addiction to determine which one we're in governments all operate in this jurisdiction
there must be a contract when you go up to a judge and you go
through this judge can i ask a question mr dumb far boy from a mill town
what is the law where did his origins come from how did we arrive at this thing called law where a small group of
men can put something down on paper and won't be done accountable
shut up but it was fun and they answered and they never give
you a good answer ever i've asked more than 300 times in courtrooms
i've never given you a good answer so you know genesis 1 26-28 this is
my comprehension of it god gave me divinity over the land the air and the water and all things that are in
the land became common this property equity rights is common law the air between
equals high school or canon law which is trust law water became faculty or commerce which is contract law
now when the prosecutor a few minutes ago misused the word jurisdiction and said it was in the county's jurisdiction
what he really meant to say was venue or locust location because all of you whether you're in the
city the county the state the federal government this agency or that agency you're all acting in this jurisdiction
and you right up and you let him answer
and if he doesn't answer you say judge are we in contract loft are we in trust
law are we in equity
we're in contract great now that we've narrowed it down to one plus one is two bring forth the contract
right it does meet all eight elements of the contract you do that and i guarantee you're going
to walk out the door instead of go behind mars
because they never will have a contract that's worth anything
they don't hold water because they base everything up consumption assumption in here
very very quick recap same thing's added question
family court contract you know the problem is we've got this kangaroo report over here so when i
stupidly bring a case into family court then do i have a contract with them that i have to fulfill until the end if
you brought it in yes yeah so how do i get rid of that contract go to a higher
court move it out move it out
but then will will that can they bring me back into family court
again because i did or it will always be in family court once it's failed
once it's in state port it's early in the morning um so you bring it to a higher court by
appealing or just by jumping over yeah you know why appeals rarely work because
an appeal system is not designed to look at your case it's designed to look at it did the
other court screw did up commit any brady violations or
nipua violations or miranda violations or this that the other okay that's why most
people lose their appeal they go to an appeals court with their case
and the appeals court says okay we're gonna we're gonna roll on behalf of the lower
court if you didn't show where the lower court committed any violations
he appealed and we won our appeal but we still got dragged into family court and we still
got not terminated but we still got the kids taken away what would you do on something like that
say family court are broke they're a rogue they're operating under their own
policy they're not operating under law so unless you bring the law in the
family court and you hold them to it remember we wrote asphalt yeah asphalt title four
two which is a social security act okay the two acts that created
child protective services and family courts both say they cannot take a child
from a parent without the parents consent so the first thing you've got to do in
your case is try and analyze it and figure out where did i screw up where did i give them my consent did i
sign a family plan for services did i bring it to family court
did i go in and not challenge jurisdiction by special
appearance was i a person a citizen or resident where did i screw up that i gave them
jurisdiction where did i contract you ask yourself
all those questions where did i mess up once you find out where you messed up go correctly
i noticed that um josh grew tears with the um casa central we contacted with them they
said that our son will come home if you contract with the casa central people basically
yeah that's exactly what they just did yeah okay their job is to string you out 18
to 24 months okay and then they can terminate your parallel price no matter what
you know you have no reason to really you know terminate us and she didn't so i mean am i right right
there it kind of proved you know they had no right right or both of these laws is clearly written in
there i mean it's clearly written there look it up bring it up put it in your court
documents kind of based here it is judge you cannot remove a child without
my consent i don't give you my consent and if i mistakenly have given you
through presumption or assumption my consent i hereby would rescind and withdraw it i have a
question what's like let's say he gives consent but i don't can like if you have a couple can like one say i
don't give consent oh yeah it happens all the time now that it's called divorce
well i don't know i'm yeah
that's right but that's what they're operating so the only way to when they're coming after you with a
problem they have the cuts they have the force and effect
that's what we got to remember otherwise we end up as some dumb sovereign citizens somewhere in some jail that's
there for a while okay they have force and effect so the words are important
we talked about this yesterday 44 out of 45 presidents have got them on camera and said
we the people are soccer yeah so when a police officer says oh that sound
like services and stuff or some judge says that or someone
are you this as a parent yes i am you go to jail are you this child's parent no i'm his father okay let's keep talking
every word freaking matters it's almost impossible if you play the uh statutory jurisdiction
that's why the most important thing and that's why i break down jurisdiction the way i do i never write jurisdictions one
word i write it as two words with the two words that you write i
write jurisdiction as two words tourists because it means write love
addiction means words the word you use determines the right law under which you
stand one thing we all need to learn is the language we've got to have language
skills
one of his star presidential speeches stuff to see if he did
so
we have two jobs in this life that's it correct the errors
are public servants man and educate them
so they don't do it again the rest of time we could be fishing
that's it so we have to point things out
learn the united states code i got i can't stress that enough the
united states building was put there for one reason one reasonable that's for we the people to hold them
accountable it was written for employees of government
so change your status your standing know your jurisdiction so that you're not an employee of
government so it doesn't apply to you you can use it to apply to them that in
which one creates one controls the national law we the people create a
government we control power when government creates a person this is
a resident they control the person that citizen okay very very important things to
remember our biggest job is to understand
that is perceived authority if we believe their authority we bow
down to them when we understand their perceived authority
we could stand up and talk to them just like our neighbor we're not afraid of them we can stand up
and say look i like you you wanna come have a beer sometime that's great or
come sit down for coffee i like you i don't have anything against you you're one of my neighbors
but under title 18 section 242 you operate under the color of law
and anything color holds a fallacy so we don't have any business together
truck i'll go down the road find somebody else that will bend over
okay it is that simple i've had police officers come up to my
gate at my house and five flight houses
ten ten acres and i have a six foot high chain-link fence
like that i can pull an entire semi in there before i have to open my lock gate
and it's jiggling with the white slats police pulls up in my driveway he's
trapped he's literally trapped in there i don't
even have to open the gate
that's a dangerous place for a police officer especially my friend
i walk up to him i reach my hand through the gate hi officer how you doing you having a
good day i treat every one of them like i would any of my neighbors
i say you're here on private business or commercial business
so i got a complaint for one your neighbors your dogs are barking too loud
whatever it doesn't matter where it says i say oh you gotta complain nobody cares
about complaining nobody wants to hear anybody complain anybody can complain about anything i can complain about your tie
didn't file a claim before they swear on an affidavit
and you're here just operating under the color of law
title 18 section 242 if you want to come over for coffee sometime you're welcome but other than
that truck off on down the road talk to somebody else a little bit
and i do that with building inspectors and everybody else they all operate
under the color a lot they're all private for-profit entities
officers policy enforcement so i'm gonna turn me off a second
well i'll tell you one cup of coffee was just not enough this morning
okay so in this business of waking up
we tend to graduate depending on how much we learn and how much time is passed and we get
better and better and better and better and better than what we do and we also change what we do so some people
they go long for 30 year period of time exactly the same doing things the same
old way and then all of a sudden it doesn't work because they legislate ahead of you
they do all kinds of things to try and shut you down to stop you
what i'm trying to get to is i'm trying to say what tell you something that i've recently learned and then i've received
it and that is not own anything go into a higher level go into
ecclesiastical trust law put everything in a trust all nothing
control everything now with my police that's not everybody's place but with my
belief i believe in god so i put everything into god trust
you guys can pass around read it look at it this is an actual recorded copy with the recorded bar
string on it and so it's one of the originals
i believe everything is his that we're just here to be good stewards
[Music]
it like all to my son and daughter without you know what i'm saying without me you can put your house in it
your car's in it you own nothing you control everything it's all in a god trust and
this is what i've done and what i've recorded so you're welcome to read it before
one of the big things is right on the irs's website it says every organization exempt from federal income tax under
internal revenue code section 501a must file an annual information return
except an exclusively religious activity of any
religious order and already number six but it's all churches
everything deals with the church and deals with god is completely exempt from filing anything they don't have to
be a bible one c3 they were exempt from the beginning they were the highest form of love
okay the air is up here the land's here and the water's down here and if you walk in the water you drown
yes you still have to bending over okay so i i think that's a very
important progression that we need to make and it takes a long time to move all your assets everything you
have your bank accounts everything into a guide trust but if you have nothing if you don't
even have any wages if you go to your employer and say hey look i've given everything to god
my entire life i'm dedicating to god that's my religious belief and i expect
you to abide by it from now on i am no longer your employee
i will work for you i will do whatever you want in god's name my paycheck now goes to the name of my
god trust is the taxing damn trust
talk to the hr get it switched over
[Music] social security is a private annuity contract
that's the way it was set up now they've bastardized it over the years they've switched all
funds into the general fund but it's still set up as a private community contract see they can't
they could invent but they have it they haven't replaced the original act
that created social security is still in effect
it was originally set up as a private annuity contract it's not even a good investment i
recommend against it it's a terrible investment if you if you're 20 years old you took 25 dollars
a month a month out of each paycheck and put in a good mutual fund you'd end up with a whole lot more retirement at 65.
than you would in social security it's a terrible investment
yeah for a lot of people okay so can you put your kids in trust
will you put your kids in a trust all right i'm teaching them all about it i've mailed them a copy
i said here's what you should do you know my kids roll over 18.
you can lead a horse to water but you can't make a dream so you just try and educate them by the school systems
when they're a minor though can you put them in your in your trust absolutely you can pass your trust down
to them your successors and our signs become the
steward god's
our daughter who's in college now why can't you put her in her trust because she's only in college she's not
you know completely yeah she'll be 19. she's going to make her own decision
you you can make her an heir to your chest she can manage it it can be the same
trust that's why mine is called the straight familiar god trust
my family name for generations
okay first you have an alienable rise
number one foundational cornerstone of all rise is your right of self-determination
you can do whatever it is you want you know why there's so many last names in the world today
what gear are you in wheels overall that's why it was farmer fletcher thatcher that started it off
but there were many many other nations in the world that started things differently if i was
a norwegian sweden norway any of those countries
and my name is david lester street and i have a son named christopher davis straight
i would have named him it would have been christopher david david's son and his last name would
become davidson straight was a family name just one way now he has a kid
and he names it david daniel christopher's son
every generation the last name changed why so the king could
fall along the same path and keep taxing on generation after
generation of your generation so that there would be no discrimination
they just changed your last name and it went on and on and on like that
and that's why there's hundreds of thousands of different last
they're not the only countries that did that either so anyway i still lost my transport
now i rarely do that i rarely lose my train of thought and go back around around circles and vacuums
when he asked this question about his kids in the trust they're cute was that when you drew the square did you remember when you drew it
who was asking what questions
but that happens anyway we were going to talk about some
specific things that deal directly with your problems
that's what we're here for is to deal with your problems so i think we want
under guardianship with my adopted parents through the state court but we never got
tpr and i just wanted to fight to get phantom because she wants to come home
and be raised by us and the last court date that we had was in may of 2017
and she stayed first she had just um the case was closed but she still
right before she was about to hit also she remembered she pulled back and she goes but i still have jurisdiction of the case
i'm going to write on my paperwork you know it's very simple everything is a
hierarchy yeah he wants to come home everything is a hierarchy it's been handed down
through generation through generation no one has a greater right to your child than you
it's uh simple no one has a greater right to your child than you so if they haven't tried and through
proper dupli process law convicted you of some kind of a felony they cannot take your child from you you
are the guardians now i don't care what they say on paper you are the guardian so what you have to
do is you have to show them in everything that's written
that's enumerated on paper in acts of congress and law and treaties and on and on and on you
can use it you can use the international covenant on civil and political rights where it says no one has period right to your
child than you you can use the uniform universal declaration of human rights
you can you can use the bill of rights you you can use our constitutions our state
constitutions there are several of our states and because of the supremacy law the agreement to all states work together
you can use laws from the state of washington in florida you can use statement laws from florida
and washington it doesn't matter so start reading all the state constitutions and i guarantee
you'll find state constitutions lots of okay that'll show that no one has a greater
right to your child than you now you go to the judge and you say judge i have this i have this i have
this i have this i have this i have this i have this this says no one has a greater right to
my child than i do there are babies and they pawn him off to like younger
men right because they can't keep up with him because he's very active
right so if you want them back you show them all the laws that say
you're supposed to have them and then what do they do if you have anything to the contrary
just bring it forward in writing what proof of fact of evidence do you have in writing that i
do not deserve my children they don't unless you break it up okay
see it goes back to you all the time it's your fault if they don't
that's right they got to have a perfect plan so what proof in truth or fact and
evidence do you have in writing that and then you finish the sentence
and you can ask in any letter or derogatory or whatever interrogatory
one is if they have jurisdiction when it's their foreign state saying you don't have jurisdiction so i
do letters of prerogatory in a letter derogatory you can ask up to
25 questions you asked 26 you're going to throw it out
okay you can ask up to 25 questions and your questions should always start with
what proof in truth or fact evidence do you have in writing that eye
an employee that i'm subject to your statute that i'm not a person a citizen or
resident that and they have to bring it forward in writing
and answer you if they don't bring it forward and write it and answer you and you've made your paperwork your court of record
or we talked about quarter record yesterday it ain't the brick building
if you want to have fun go to go online and type in court of record
i think it's quarter record dot org
it's all about against paperwork on all their court cases telling kings
and queens to presence what to do it's kind of fun to read and it's a
court of record say a court of record is not the building a court of record is your paperwork
properly served publicly published and filed in your
a case of record is your paperwork properly served
publicly published and then filed in your case thank you
well let me tell you the ways there's lots of ways you can put in the newspaper for 21 days you put
it on a bulletin board with two friends witnesses and they swear out an affidavit that you placed a year on the state of such and
such a time and it was there for 21 days you can go to amazon.com and put in the
book sell for 90iss publicly publish you can
record it to your county recorders under miscellaneous document
there's many lessons and there's many many many ways a lot of the counties will give you
headquarters some won't do it oh yeah
many times okay oh yeah you just do it anyway they'll say no that's your job do it yeah i have a
notice to clerk and it tells the law and it says court clerk if you don't
file it you're committing a felony
that's right they do or clerk is the main president not the judge not the prosecutor the
court clerk is the main president
you have to serve all opposing parties if you've got a cps case you've got a lot of parties to serve
you've got the guardian of the lineups you got the attorneys you got the judges you got cps
probably several individual agents you you should serve them in both their private and their public capacity
okay so we found out that a couple of the uh caseworkers from gcfs and in
one case were from casa central no longer employed by them and we had asked their lead i actually talked to their
legal department and i said well i need their their information so i can
serve them and they said you know we're not going to give you their home their home address and go
west side either um something like uh truthfighter.com works real well you
have 19.95 a month and then you can find any questions yeah they have to treat them
yeah you can do that too boy it works within three days they have to
they have a three day limit on it you like whatever it is they try and charge you because they're trying to give you actual copies tell them that you want an email or pdf form and they'll let you
know what to do and
what they had told me was if i wanted to serve the ex-employee they wanted me to serve
them there but i told them i said i need to also serve them as an individual
you know they're separate and that's why they were saying that they would number their home address but so do i just go you can
find anybody do i serve them at the same time at the same age even though they're not working there no get their home address
i recommend dossiers on everything i love those now what is that nobody wanted to do
that better than federal agents take a dot a dossier is a file holder that you create on
pretty soon you know your names your addresses or phone numbers where they work what car they drive their license
plate where they park often at their work you know what color their car is make a model
serial number you know everything about how many kids they have how many times they've been married how
many times they've been in trouble write it all down these people start
getting belligerent
and following their own policies instead of following the law now it's your job now your job kicks in
to hold them accountable now you sue them yourself i'm using the united states code
suzanne federal court you can take your city municipal
director and suit the federal court under the united states code
it's another thing trump helped us with we no longer have to exhaust a state court before going to federal court
we go right to federal court another question um you were saying
something about we only have so many questions that we can ask for you know 25. um what was that
25 questions and what are derogatory or a letter of interrogatory interrogatory is where you're still in
their jurisdiction let me tell you another place a lot of
people that learned to stop making mistakes
when they're coming after you and you're in the defensive mode instead of the
offensive mode you try to be a man suitors a living
soul you remove yourself from their
jurisdiction you challenge jurisdiction always challenge jurisdiction
what happens when it's your time to go after them
if you go after them and you're claiming to be a man sue juris you can only go after the man's suitors
you can't force them to do anything they have the unalienable right of something they can be that person says the
resident all you want you can't do anything so how do you go after it go in this pro se
go in as the person god gave us dominion over all three jurisdictions
can walk amongst it if i could be a commonwealth in one minute admiralty a lot of the next minute
ecclesiastical on the next minute and back and forth and i don't have to hear this for it
or say one is wrong
one you're the offense the other you're the defense
okay they're acting as public servants they're actors say that over and over
again they're actors because they're in private for profit entities okay i just remembered what i was going
to put in the box going to come just a little slow this
morning
know your enemy and i'll tell you what
if the city of woodgale police department is coming after you and they charged you with some crime
doesn't matter what we're just going to pull something out of thin air doesn't matter
a crime or us whatever yeah the statutory violation is fine i
don't care that's what they will work under anyway but they'll they'll use the word current
okay i'm just saying assuming we haven't satisfied or supply corpuscle
everything we're saying works right know your enemy who are they
you got a police officer involved right a policy enforcement revenue collection agent that's what it really is
who else you got involved probably the city attorney
who becomes a prosecutor
what city what is the name of the city wood dale right
i don't know it's one or two words i don't care the police department the city of
wooddale police department is a separate entity
from the city of woodland it's got a different donor brad street number
it's got a different manta.com report then you have the city of wooddale which
has a don brass street number an event.com report then it's in the courthouse
get the name of the courthouse it's a private for-profit business too
and look at their denim browser and their manta.com report
you'll tell a lot of times their credit rating in arizona the supreme court of arizona
has a lousy credit rating they only have a three million dollar credit limit and they don't pay their
bills for 120 days
days that's four months they're four months late if you build
them okay so know these things about
look them up i wouldn't know that about the supreme court of arizona except i looked it up see so look it up
researched every single one in utah i found out that the first district
court of cash county is owned by one man whose corporate
headquarters lives in ogden utah and he owns seven county courthouses
just like a mcdonald's franchise do you think they're government it's
owned by one man it's a private for-profit entity yeah then brass street what was the
other thing you're saying amanda.com
keeps track of all all registered corporations and you pull up the report the first
thing i'll say is private private corporation okay
now woodale is located in what county
it's a cricket cook cook yeah what we call it
i think it's crook what's the salt for fun okay kurt county look up kirk county's
double brass street number their meta.com report they're a private for-profit entity
look up state of illinois they're a
private for-profit entity probably located in 444
north congress avenue washington dc
that's where their business address is located that's where their corporate registry is that's where their corporate charter
is registered what happens if
you start a business and you register it with the state and you register your corporate charter
for the state and then you don't follow your corporate chart the state can come in
and close this down if he doesn't call his corporate charter
what's good for the goose is good for the gander right
they got a corporate charter
it's called the constitution of the state look at the constitution if they're
operating outside their scope and authority which they do on a daily basis
going from the legislature with order to remove and revoke their corporate charter oh now you're going to turn
some heads they're never going to do it but you're going to turn some heads and
you're going to challenge the statute that's against the constitution as
void for any effect and they'll have to bring with that to
be statute off the books if you challenge that through the legislature that way
you want to change your laws that's how you change your laws if they don't comply to the constitution
of the state and the federal government then they're void for any effect but
it's up to the people to bring it up to the legislature they're not going to do it on their own
they're all attorneys they're actors to attorneys they're
going to write these laws to mess with you start messing with them it's a lot
more fun right you want to go up the ladder you
got the united states corporation look up their gun and breast
street network then you got the imf
what's this [Music]
under the securities exchange administration which by the way was also founded with
the world bank and the imf they're required to keep it perspectives
do you know the united states government has a prospectus
couldn't sell united states church rebonds if they do
this this is really fun who always required to keep the prospectus everybody and
everybody so all the way down to mr police wow if they're selling if they're selling
investments they're required to yeah so down to the city probably
probably what's imf stand for again
right international monetary fund if you go to any investment council go to fidelity
and say hey i want to i want to see the prospectus on ibm i want to invest in ibm
he has to give you the perspective that well it's not
that fidelity so you have to sign up you have to sign whatever yeah is there a monthly fee
you've got a lot you've got to create a login and there's a monthly fee or something i'm pretty sure
when i went on there they could but it's well worth it just like that just i've never been
charged really you created a login i don't know i don't know why they i wasn't able to okay so
once you have all this now what have you just done you have taken and proved that they are
de-facto
that they are now actors acting as government you've rebutted the presumption
once you do that how can anyone who is not is your government of
we the people rule over you can
somebody brought mcdonald's room over you or walmart or costco huh
only if you can send contract that's right you can also complete the contract by accepting benefit we've all accepted benefits in
our pockets right now so they work both ways what you're saying on their side with devil's advocate okay
we've already said all right let's get out of that real quick all right yeah that's a contract they'll say that
they'll bring it up on their computer screen judges have computers at their desk now sometimes sure and and there you go wow here's his
report yeah he's a he's a citizen a person a resident we we have jurisdiction
wait a minute judge you know the nice thing about fraud is at some point in time
very important some point in time fraud must be recognized
yeah i received benefits at one time i had no idea i was unknown
i was stupid i was just a car boy from a military information i accepted some benefits but then i
recognized the fraud i learned i got educated i studied
i see the problem look at this you guys are all private
for-profit businesses you're de facto you're acting and pretending to be government
under the color of law anything callable is a fallacy rules code statutes and ordinances
you're not laws shop versus ring okay on and on and on
since governments have chosen to incorporate themselves it must follow the same rules as any other corporation
they operate under the color of law to deprive you of your rights
under corporate bylaws if i'm an employee of government
state of oregon seems to pay their uh guys that drive around those little white state vehicles at least 50
60 000 a year where's my check
where's my health insurance where's my purse retirement fund
if i'm going to be an employee and you're going to consider me an employee pay up
see i recognize the fraud here on earth and once i recognize the fraud and i
bring it out into the open civilization and fraud must be investigated always
everything to have an issue from the beginning somebody somebody could go along with
fraud for a long time i could write you a check thirty dollars a month because you told me some story and
and i i give you a check and then one day i realized that she's just putting
in her own pocket she's not dealing with it what she told me of a sport that's fraught
and now i can stop panderers and now i'd go after for every time i ever gave you
yeah because at some point in time i recognized the fraud i woke up
that's the day the wheel falls off lasting okay that points everything from the
beginning when fraud is first recognized
that's what you use that's how you win that argument in a quarter that's good once you win every time if
you can out debate them that's all it takes and if they try to speak over yeah i just hold them above
my hand like a school crossing guard stop in traffic one time i held up my hand like this in court for about
i don't know 20 minutes my arms get tired and the judge looks at me and this you gotta go to the bathroom
i said no but i didn't sure want to be
heard
but you have to rebut everything in every presumption okay and then on
that way you can take off the barcode right those 12
presumptions i was reading yesterday if you don't provide all 12 resolutions syllogism too
since you weren't on an airplane okay so um i'm a health insurance broker
also everybody who has individual health insurance gets tax credits so they can afford their
policy so not only are people you know they don't have to be on public aid but at
anybody making under 120 grand they're getting paid by the government so they can afford their insurance let me tell
you something if they're young and healthy i recommend taking their 325
a month insurance premium and put it in a good mutual fund and then when they do need to go to the doctor they'll have a
couple hundred grand in there to pay for it that's all an insurance policy is anyone
and or if you're not paying you're just putting in their savings account so that they're free to use the
money until they have to pay out nine times out of ten the vast majority
of people are healthy for a long period of time now if you're dealing with somebody
my age seldom and insurance policy
but if they don't go get securities license sell them a mutual fund if they're 25.
yeah but but if you decide if you do that you're not paying taxes anyways you can take all that money and put it
towards exactly right and if you don't own anything because it's all in the god dress and you have to go in the hospital you get cancer
yeah the more you guys learn the more money seems to stay in your
pocket all the time it's really a wonderful thing
had i known this stuff 30 years ago oh my gosh i've been rich
three times in my life and i've been bored three times
hey sometimes it's easier to make than it is to keep because women can talk out
loud i told my son my son says you want to meet my new girlfriend
i said just buy her a house you get married you're going to end up
buying a house anyway
so this is all acquiescence and adhesion contrasting of course that's what it all is
that's what it all is so the the trick is being able to ask
them the right question they're coming after you they're trying to come after you for some reason it doesn't matter
what it is a traffic ticket or stealing your kids or whatever they're coming after taxes
and you your job is to ask them 25 questions
to show that they have no contract whatsoever
what proof do you have in truth back then this in writing that i am an employee of your
corporation
a driver's license is a contract to operate in commerce but if i'm not operating in
congress i have a i've got a driver's license i drive a semi truck a lot of hate
sometimes i can operate in this jurisdiction or i can handle my passport
i am not going to handle this if i'm traveling they're going to get this maybe this
do you stick it in it no no what is that brown book what does that mean the declaration of independence so the
constitution of the united states it's all in that little book it's only 10 you've got to worry about anything
after 10 is unconstitutional anyway it is yeah but you got to remember who
you're dealing with yeah so this is what i'm trying to try to get through to patriot groups sovereign assistance whatever
okay i love anybody who stands up they're my neighbors i love them all
right but they go by the 26th
right it's there to limit government this these documents were created
they have nothing to do with me i don't love god's laws unalienable rights
this limits them so who cares if the 26 wasn't ratified
and this 14th wasn't ratified they believe it was they have the right of
self-determination that's what i bought to protect their rights
they believe it is it doesn't apply to me it allows me to hold them accountable
it all applies to that it all applies that was the intent read
the federalist papers and then in federal newspapers read the law of nations how to set up a nation okay they tell
exactly how they could help and um pain you know our founding fathers
this is all no kidding yeah okay all international law here this is all based on international law
and states only recognize states unless you've established your own state yeah what is a state
it's a nation each each state is an independent nation state yes it's all international but you have
to have land to control or in this case now you can have virtual remainder to control states will only recognize
states not its inhabitants or populists so they're seeing you as an inhabitant you're populous and you're not your own
state so you have no
ground yeah
so what do you think i know him very well yeah he's got a good premise if he wants to yeah he also has the dog
own country but you know what once he does that the united states doesn't like the thing
he's doing they're going to take him out one little drop of obama and they've got every right to do that hold on no the
book has been following the bill in our international law states cannot harm states he's safer than any one of
us individually yeah tell that to zombies tell it out to qaddafi tell them
assassination all of them we are the army for the central bank yeah
we're the water jurisdiction we're the sort that's right jurisdiction that's right
and westminster also known as london is our land that's right let's see
the united states of america is right here okay the united states is over there and the
united states is over there it's controlling everything is being controlled
right here every the name of every organization on earth you can
write on that line i want those longest and as that organization these people are
all our neighbors or you and i they're good honest moral people
as they go into power they start committing to seven deadly
sins greed blood said
then they're controlled that can this group controls every organization on earth
every church
every organization on earth you didn't get to hear this yesterday
but repeat it one more time this is a really important story that all of you should be telling someone else you can use any name
any person just graduated from that law school seattle washington
and he went to work for a big attorney firm he just passed the bar so they held a party for it
they rented the restaurant at the space field and the whole attorney firm and
everybody out there was having a party and dinner and everything and afterwards the kid
who the party was forced and they're looking out the windows the head of the attorney firm
walks up puts his arm around him says you see all that
some of the biggest corporations in the world got bullied amazon microsoft
on and on and see even those little corporations joe's
fishing all these little corporations who do you think controls
all of that and the kid turned trump says ceos of the companies
this is no there's not one ceo that has run every single piece of paper
every single decision past
shift the bar association is the army of the
bankers the bankers sit back and smoke their cigar and big battle chairs and tell the lawyers what to do
because they control the persons and the lawyers do their dirty thing
and they create contracts in government forms never fill out a government form
create your own you can use their forms for information and stuff of any type of
way they're all bred by lawyers they're all designed to do one thing to take away the government's liability
and place it all upon you every single government form you fill
out every form at a doctor's office a hospital or any private business was
written by their attorney firm
know that right up front once you realize those kind of things
now you can write your own contract so they're fair and equitable between two of them
but what about the parsy syntax that you know it just decimates every contract that i mean i know you've watched hours of it i wanted
to know what to drop i've been today with one miller's house i went to a studio okay i've known those guys for 20 years
i helped dave windmiller get out of the problem with the fbi okay
so i can tell you story after story but like that's not the important thing
parsons grammar's great is ahead of his time it proves every contract is fraudulent
and there's not it's a different language no judge knows how to read
dave lost more cases than he won and he won agreement but he lost a lot
of cases simply because the judge says i don't understand the language i'm
foreign what's it called partisan bank administrators read their local rules
let's let's go back here again
all right let's go back here again know your enemy
ask the
okay
you look up their local rules
and if you read that thoroughly you're going to see that there's a rule that says they can break their own rules oh goodness
even even in a federal court i know a guy that was totally railroaded in federal court not only that it was set up
by an irs agent
i'll tell you a little secret story anyway this guy was one of the top
bankers in the world and he was a water
five generation logging and he married his high school
sweetheart that he knew since second grade and her last name was paige
after they were married had a couple of kids they were sitting around talking about
their family and she asked if
he wanted to go to their family and he said sure they drive
to connecticut and they drive to this castle this monstrous
big grounds long drive all gated drive up butler comes to the door
says sit right here i'll go announce that you're here
looks on the coffee table and there's a newspaper just cut this picture this is an old newspaper and he's
looking at it he's wondering who these people are and she walks by and says all this all my
family that's my uncle you'll meet him
and the baller comes back and he walks out and they walk through the house to the
backyard he throws the glass doors open and they walk out into this giant
manicured courtyard with a tent white chairs hundreds of people walking around the
table set up caterers and everything else any walks
out there and his wife starts introducing him to
the family
and they knew everything about it they knew he ran a 500 million dollar a year
logging operation hundreds of trucks two of the largest he was the largest
hardwood veneer mill producer in the world
500 million dollar a year business and they do it all and they swept him into the banking
world by saying you can run all your companies just the way you're doing it now and we'll give you another 350 000 a
year plus perks
all kinds of intelligence agencies squashing as every move is back keeping us
okay everywhere he went every country he went to he was protected if he went to
israel he's protected by massage friends french foreign legion sweden
their national guard on and on and on wherever he wanted was protected
extra 350 000 a year and that was just pennies compared to this
but he was honest and he was warm he was upright and he got into that
making world and he was top bankers in the world and he started
seeing things he was put there to handle all their lumber transactions worldwide
with with people like this
and he had he was doing he'd do a 500 billion dollar lumber deal with some nation
and then he'd do the wire see look at the wire transfer that happened and it was
a lot more than that and he started to realize that that's how they were funding armies and funding government
they just tack on to contracts extra dollars and that helps fund all
these other things so one day he saw a transaction
that made when he stopped this transaction and made world news he stopped
bill and hillary clinton [Music] in a multi-billion dollar transaction
and another transaction he allowed to go through because they were trying to stop it
and that was to benjamin netanyahu
so he started working for whoever was in the right versus who was going wrong
and today he's home he's with his wife and kids in his house it's early in the morning and
black helicopters land in his yard and swat teams show up and everything and this lady all dressed
in a suit gets out of a suv walks into his house
opens the scrub door walks into a broom closet by his kitchen grabs a broom handle goes up the stairs
he went in a 17 square foot home on 3 000 acres in indiana
and she walked up into the second floor room and she went like that she had a ceiling tile just similar
to this one and 14 million dollars in cash dropped
off of the floor they put into the handcuffs they took the federal
courthouse they put him in jail for five years and he's out on lifetime parole until he
pays the irs back 450 000 in taxes
that wasn't his money somebody stuck it there and she knew exactly
which ceiling title he had in his 17 000 square foot house
huh they set him up mm-hmm
you know what the judge did time bar 2255 every single one of his topics
i've helped him file five documents notice of special appearance just trying
to get him off probation because he has to be in the same house every night they paint his phone every
he lost all that he lost his wife he lost his kids he lost his properties he lost his car
he lost his businesses he lost his logging company's 500 million dollar a year business gone five generations
of work done he lost all that while he was in the five years in prison he had nothing when he got out of prison
he had to move into his sister's house and rent a room in his sister's house and go back
to lobby it took months to save up enough money i think his sister wanted the money to buy
us a chainsaw so he could go out and fall trees and start making a living again
and out of every check you have to give them half of them towards that 450 000
now he lives in a piece of property that he bought on contract and it's
one of those little mini homes here right here maybe about like that
i've been to his animals there and then he's got a guard and he keeps his chainsaw and stuff in
there's nothing there he has no assets only at all
because he owes money on that little mini mall and he knows money on the land as much as he's worth and so what he
actually owes he can throw on the back of the could he speaker do a trust
well yeah there's a lot of things he can do now we've actually not gotten transformed and recorded
but what i'm trying to say is he has no assets even his pickup his sister signed the
loan for he owes more on it than his worth because he bought a used dodge four-wheel drive pickup because he has
to go into the woods sometimes a rolling center body and washed out you know just to do his job
i think it was more of this work so really he's got some clothes a few pots and
pans that's it this man was at the top of the world
he was flying around the g7 that he controlled told him where to go
he's welcome now you know did he not have a trust or
would he would that even help the out of trust it would have helped a lot but this is what they did to him the
clintons destroyed him they said they destroyed it they did not kill him
uh
so anyway
you have to prove you're not a citizen person a resident you got to know your status in your jurisdiction you got to know your
enemy you're going to know that they're de facto you have to know how to combat
that and prove that the burden of proof of your crime is on them
but the only way to establish that state of jurisdiction that burden first on you okay so
and i'd like to talk about this so you know i'll
he's going to give you the lame house answer if he even answers a lot of times you stomp him right there
they've never been asking a question okay and you hold your hand up like it stops and saying
i'm just a double farm boy from middletown in oregon that's what i say but my comprehension
is in genesis 1 26 through 28 god gave me a man demeaning over the land here in
water the land is common law calling is property equity and rights
the heirs of ecclesiastical or kennel off which is trump's law the waters have a leader congress which is contract law so when the
prosecuting attorney missed use the word jurisdiction on purpose to confuse the general public
if what he was willing to just say is venue or focus location because this is the city's
jurisdiction the county's jurisdiction the the federal government jurisdiction is
aren't they all operating in the same journalists contract law
judge aren't they okay you have to get them to speak
sometimes you got to judge can you answer that question
and he'll say yes okay now you've established the basis of math one plus one is two you've got down
there's three jurisdictions of law one jurisdiction is you've got down to
their operating in this jurisdiction contract lot and it's a simple matter bring forth contract it doesn't meet all
eight elements of the contract in certain privity of contract meaning once
disclosure terms and conditions consideration to winning signatures by two life parties
they can never supply them there and then they say you're a stash toward jurisdiction
statutory is not a jurisdiction that's what they say now you can say okay show me where i can
study the statutory jurisdiction so i can defend what i say is statutory is not a
jurisdiction right it is under contract law
show me the contract what proof do you have in truth factored
out is that i am an employee of whatever it happens to be
that i'm an employee of the city of woodland i'm an employee of the kirk county but i'm an employee in the state of illinois that i'm an employee
of the united states that i'm an employee of the u.n what perfect truth and fact and evidence do
you have that eye and you just go on and on and on starting every sentence that way
because they've got the on burden right you're that's what you're doing you're throwing them back you're asking
questions that throw the burger back on them that they have to answer this would be post
arraignment though so you've already said something i said i sent them a
notice of appearance and a water organatory and an error aquarium note was right off the bat

and have lunch I've set my appointment for one I go in
and show them my affidavit and I say title 8 section 1101 821 is my status
please issue me a passport that reflects them
you have to say in your ds11 is properly filled out with
the two pictures in your ID and he goes back and he does his little
research slip of paper that says
we're going to issue a passport affiliated the two days later you get it
this way it works is you know
you've got to understand that that's a financial document it doesn't make you a citizen
nothing makes you it says in fact under the United States code if
you claim to be a citized we all commit that all the time because
more none of us are born as a citizen
we're born to say National and then we accept state citizenship
through our own right of interpretation which is called lack of knowledge yeah
and we accepted them we checked some boxing and we became they let you fall into the trail and they do it through
propaganda and advertising sort of kindergarten through 12th grade kids up on stage four score and seven
years ago to follow coppers uh step by step but copper is in Congress right now
has been it's been updated for socially not using social
pretty much they've used the social media because a few years ago okay here's the
problem every Secretary of State makes his own homes
every time we get a regime change and Secretary of State's office have a different happens under John Kerry he
said no I don't want to see any affidavits you handle everything through the past four months so you took you out David in the
passport and I sit there with me yeah next guy said
you better send us your affidavit so we don't want to see him at the passport office
they instantly changed the rules so every time there's a new secretary of
state they change the rules he does a pretty good job of keeping up on
there might be able to have time in there where he's wrong [Music]
what happens
this is a little one-page piece of paper that says certified proof of service I hereby
certify that on this day the bound attached affidavit was signed
for received as a testitude by the Casual proof of England return receipt
if you don't have a regular receipt you go to traffic tracking number or whatever you just put
it right there in that box then you sign it and have the witnesses or you can have it elderized right there
now you've done your proof of service that they got they're not going to respond to it so don't worry about it
but you have to give them the opportunity to respond they need 21 days of legal to respond so on the 22nd day
make sure one second day notice the default certified Judgment of
unrebutted affidavits here I am found attached in some pain Dash and then you put the name of your
affidavit I hereby certify that on this day
which is on or after the 22nd day following the date of the ballot
attached certified service that was properly served and dated on this day I
hereby declare by my honor and under my authority as one of we the people and
under the laws of the United States of America that it in the an affidavit unrebutted in 21
days becomes the judgments signing a couple Witnesses or
you do a notary insurance certificate
to yourself
if you're married and your spouse doesn't do this
that's what I'm wondering sir
three letters
my rule of thumb for absolutely every fish is am I asking permission
if you're asking permission in any way you're giving them all the power Secretary of State
Lottery yeah
okay yeah that's just Federal secretary so good questions so
sorry the passport that's there that's different than the passport that I have
right now though
you're a citizen they're going to look exactly the same when you when you get under this secretary there's no way to
identify because it says this U.S national or citizens because this
secretary just said my rule is everything's in the barcode hmm good
who knows everything's in the park if you just do this
well judgment now yeah it says on or after the 22nd there
I take minda's passport agency why because it is
evidence in writing that I made a determination to change my steps
and in there and documented line it says title a sexual Bible one age 21 is my
steps so they can't issue me another
passport that says anything other than the status I've already claims
I can't do it all right so then there's no question
okay so that's how to get that passport in the correct form that's an important agent insane
here's my affidavit I've already declared my status this title a section 1101 821 please issue your passport that
reflects that okay
but this is before but this is before
in my life
and this is the section 8110 yep every
I said it too the president of the United States the secretary of state which is the only one
that's over here required to send to but I settled with the president I said to the Secretary of State I sent into the
attorney general in the United States and assisted to the Secretary of State the state I was born and was sent up to
the Secretary of State in the state I've chosen to enhance and anytime there's a regime change
I change because I want them to know what this
says I'm hoping someone in their office supported it but you're right we did all those nasty
and crazy and awful things to our old people we've got to stop this
is the npu I believe
it's not a solicitation you're literally writing block and then
you do this right that's right that's right so anyway it's an Affidavit of Truth and
an assertory oath so it's an old it's my repudiation and
revocation of citizenship so that's what I'm titled it
and it's 32 pages and I'll tell you what
I wrote this document years ago and I one of the attorneys that I met
and I've worked with was a man called Mel Stamford
elephant was a kind of degree doctor's degree in
one very smart man I want him over our side
and he wrote a book called fruit from a poisonous tree and if you agreed chapter
I think it's two you're gonna see his version of my
document the words are almost the same
he took a few things out he didn't fly to him
this one a lot
of repudiation versus pushing
Railway the machine is just a change to change something to get rid of it repudiation is to justify the reason why
I am here by everybody I'm reputable
okay okay David a really good word to use
oh yes you support the audience
great word to use in your documents it's a great word to use when you'll speak with any of your enemies
um okay so to change your status here's what you do now there's all kinds of other things so go ahead
so that's to get to the passport but like they have their National cards this is to change your steps okay but how do
you get the card it's just part of the this is a book oh it is for a card so do you actually have the book as well like
another 15 books or whatever yeah to get the book okay so that is your passport that I saw yeah you can't use it to air
travel yeah I use it for my everything I use the book to air travel yeah yeah
okay
partner okay I just didn't understand I thought there was one more step okay thank you
the Bahamas or any other United States territual on Virgin Islands
okay yeah good good word to use
something else okay there's all kinds of other documents why we do other photographies
I do a patented Nativity you know what a patented Nativity is you ever heard of that
foreign showing that my DNA existed on these
Shores before there was a government the grandfather the right only source
1607 another in 1609 seven on the Mayflower it's 16 20. seven of my
grandfathers from other people
patented Nativity shows legal Authority prior to God
and it shows all my genealogy going back the beginning
before it's found so now I record that with County Recorder if I
take that into court
it's a patent it is properly published properly recorded
they're trying to say otherwise now they just committed patented
you need to reconface giving them they're all caps name that
which one creates One controls you created you can have it
unacceptable yeah why would I want to do a DPA why
would I want to authenticate a person why would I want to do anything crap that just proves they create and it
exists as all it does it does nothing for me show me one person that's ever
authenticated any of that crap and has done anything for them prove it
nobody can put it up to me I've asked everybody I've asked hundreds of people on Facebook the internet
different blogs prove that that does anything show me the perks
for you they can't do it so I don't do it I do a better Nativity I do a deed of reconves
how do you know does your genealogy way back no
I found out the two of my grandmothers their DNA exists on this country in the
1400s on this soil
out of the towels
here's what it does it proves your intentions a judge how can you say stand there and
say that I'm in your jurisdiction when I've done this and this
and this and this does not occur by intent
oh holy crap he's buried right here
your chances very important and long
see what's this little number right here that somebody direct grandmothers and
grandfathers I've traced back more than 2 000 years of 18 000 .
direct relationship what
happened yeah start with ancestry.com
the hardest period of time to get through is the beginning of our nation around
1600. once you break into the you pass that break in the 1400s
your geology loss will explode again so
there's me and my brothers sisters and my kids and then my mom and dad and their mom and dads and their mom and
dads but we can go Generation by Generation by generation
pick one and just keep caught some of them I go 30 72 Generations back
past Pompeii pre-roll
queen of Helena married the king of Troy the king of the queen
one of my grandmothers and grandmothers
so you know it's kind of fun it's kind of interesting it helps you learn history how do you find all that like my wife's
adopted so how did she do her Gene knowledge is 23andMe
did he had any helps So based on the chance of yours through the Jeep no she doesn't have to if she
knows find out who repairs were some people can't that are adopted and
so again but yeah it's harder for some than others
and if you get into Royal lines
any other questions so you guys need me to cover
for so many warnings with English
citizenship and what a quagmire that becomes yes I would never do that
right now
so yeah just be really careful going through all this process
that's my fear you know you know like you just said that the the now wait a second we'll do something
sure about stuff before you turn it down questions
relinquish versus repudiation what's up no really appreciate yourself
you can't just go say I'm relinquishing my citizenship I want out and whatever
oh and not cleaning your National status yeah you're of no State then yeah
it's like saying I just want my Social Security yeah
foreign
all right how do you learn
letters and dress people who lives during this time I spent two years in DC in the National
Archives every ceremony would you say you read between and Franklin and
all of those horrible letters hundreds of thousands of letters
two two years there I was uh they're a Jag Prosecuting a blind commanding
officer every off hour which was a lot of off
hours three times a week you see Prosecuting
your grannies all right so all your my off hours I was hitting
the museums the National Archives I was reading of the State of Florida
hours and hours and hours a day
office another kids my dad out of the military
because she refused to lie to a peon like they wanted in the court to live
straight out lie about something so then he kicked vacation not to do the reserves um because you're refused A Lot
on the stands
a little package he made a choice I took him I I did very
much the same thing okay he was content yeah quit doing what you're doing and
come and work at Jack because you're good at it
I had a question on the um appreciation
um does that that would prevent you from being that much voting like
a presidential election can we vote as Nationals the government's your help
thank you for bringing up well no whatever
you resend your voter Park
resend it because once you become a we the people and you have limited diplomatic immunity
under the Geneva conventions as one who created government not one created by God
then you are eligible for
the Electoral status fluid selections
I was going to say are you now you're 10 people your vote is worth 10.
wow so you resend your voter card
you sent an Affidavit of electoral status to your secretary of state and
you get them to certified that
then you can walk into Indie voting booth with that letter
and your vote counts as 10 votes
wait a second I just made that up what do you mean 10 votes
twirl it's really cool so it's your room I've never registered to vote but I don't have to understand
anything no
some people register when they when they get their Garden places and don't even know they register I have always said no
because they ask me yeah this is a lot of sneaky ways to get yourself
you can present and cancel it online there's been found I'm not doing that
you know like we'll received so relocation of election electoral status
change I got all kinds of there there's my document can we have
changed my electoral status so
you send that in they will certify it and send it back to you cancel my voter registration under the registered mail
account number and uh
electoral steps so then you bring that certification to any voters and they would have to like
work that along with your next year passport
one because that's the rules that they
set up here are we the people one who created you elect your representatives
only citizens vote for them big difference between the left and both
the company exactly I hired the employees
and you're right if these people are all sheep under the company then they're yeah well their votes aren't worth
anything so yeah
all these little things you can do gosh go to court take care you need to go to all the churches with this
hey judge how can you presume this in my citizen of person resident well I have
electoral status that's as much of an outcomes raiser as the passport is on
days
so on and on and on there's all kinds of things you can show your intent
to check in the cannibal and rice has a whole list of things exception for some
reason she misses these two things that's required
that's always bothered me about it everything else I love her to death yeah
me too it's a lot of haters though I don't understand the intro well you know
everyone swaps she'll she'll do a hundred good letters in a row and then
all every once in a while she goes way off the deep end okay operate Everybody by percentages
the only person that's a hundred percent is good everybody else makes mistakes I make
mistakes I'll look at myself somewhere around the 80 90 I hate to ignore it
myself yeah right here is 80 percent
because every once in a while she goes on the deep end and it's just out there and she doesn't do simple things that are actually
required in you she'll do all this stuff and that's something
we'll do two things that you're required to do
okay this is how great now you have it what do you do with it can you establish
um outside you can go fishing see once you have it you can go fishes
once you have it you're truly free I don't even get a fish
oh my gosh I go fishing I can do all the substance fishing I want
I could treat my family anytime I want to be like hunting license
hunting license
so when the DNR comes and shows up and you just show them your go ahead write
me a ticket yeah I guess I'm gonna I don't need to deal with you write me a ticket
contract is not accepted right here's my status here's my electoral status here
it says here's that oh okay never hear from him again
I don't care about police officer riceman okay someone said that they're sending now DNR agents in with these CPS
people because they don't have to go in DNR doesn't need a warrant
so they're sending DNR in to go in to get these kids I'm like do not resuscitate
what are they going to say like that I'm like coaching in my house overnight you know but that's what they're doing
that's what they've lowered themselves now I know DNR to these City people right
but that's just that's pretty low
presumption assumption taxes agreement
hears it they lead you down a path to a predetermined outcome
called Railroad railroad blocks a lot of dictionary says delete someone down in your bathroom
rail to a predetermined outcome or conclusion
presumption assumption positive agreement and hearsay
this is how our judicial system works those are the four most important words
in the law so then this is how they screw you when you know
how they screw you you can figure out how to get out you rebut their presumptions you know
about their assumptions you take remove your taxes agreement
and you call for truth fact and first-hand Witnesses and intense
that's what we want to do it's really simple you know the basics
of law which is what I'm trying to teach you and the only way I know how I've tried
it for 20 years I made this complicated nobody was listening for 10 years I
started to make it simpler and simpler and simpler and then people started to listen
because it's got to be simple
one day I wrote this down on a piece of paper I wrote the presumption in I wrote an assumption I wrote that Supreme and I
wrote here to say and somebody in the audience that was smarter to me looked at it and says
that's how they lead you down the path
first yeah
so your job is to show ask questions to prove intent
you had no intent to commit a crime never if you don't have an intent
there's no crime cases hereby dismissed that's why they
won't let me ask questions right so they use presumption assumption task
agreement and hearsay of your work agreement of your status standing in
jurisdiction three most important things in law that have to be established before a case can
begin have you ever heard the term all the
persons are equal on the wall Richard poor black or white doesn't matter
can't get up he has no standing you all have equal standing because you're all dead but
when a man walks in the room the proper status I'm the only one in the room was
standing here on her you operate
the realm of the Dead you summoned if you did the same performance sounds you're wearing the
black rose all runs yeah exactly let's see okay
Jesus password thing again and do it Anew with the affidavit we're leaving the way I have it
David contribution
so when you're not falling into their bear traps in the courtroom um
of course because I haven't established my standing yet um lawfully I'm working on it
but if I have to go into court first my question was going to be you know
because I do not you can't stand for the judge you're standing is Genesis well the
point is when when she walks in and I don't stand they're either going to kick me out or I just decided I wasn't going
to be in there when she comes in then I don't have to worry about that it's the law the superior law of your
skin right there okay it says
and I got created that from the dust of the earth and I breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man
became a living soul
living Soul can't even die the body can die Returns the Earth disgust again
the soul is on forever
I'll tell you a funny story I was in need and
upper England out the countryside and saw this big castle the little sign that said daily tours
one to three huh it's one third I drove up I wanted to go get a closer
one of his castle was pretty unique I walked up guy comes over answers the
door he looks at me and he thinks he falls over in face and he hits the
ground I came about it and he's faded so I opened the door I walk in and say hey does anybody here
this guy just painted needs help three four people come
they take a look at me one guy back up against swamp just like that
we got fuels you know what the heck's wrong these guys are like backing away from me
one of them goes are you here to climb the castle
this is already here at Clinton yes
on the wall that was painted twelve hundreds
of you of meeting each Old Iron Guard
turned out that castle was over one of my grandfathers and I was just exactly like it
I think I literally failed it so did you claim the castle did you claim the castle
here today because I'll tell you what if I would have hired a painter and sat down for two weeks while he painted it
just like that so if they asked you that then they're waiting for someone to come claim the
castle are you sure you weren't supposed to no I'm not sure
2003. I didn't I didn't even know how before
well obviously there's I mean they were expecting someone to come home
before you learn the less you know yeah
it's like you're always discovering so anyway yeah funny story
these are the little things this is one plus one in mathematics okay
I'm trying to show you that it doesn't take a lot to win cases you don't have to know every law book there is and
and all of that you don't but you do have to know your status jurisdiction
you gotta know what they're doing to you down a path you gotta believe that
they're not Authority put the burden proof back on them
but ask them the questions that doesn't that they can't answer once you stop
them they can't answer the questions they can't out debate you it's over with
every case if you just know this a little bit let's see
The Hope comes out of the bible really knowledge of all this development
so [Music]
intent
it's very dirty judges run right through a trial run
right through you put you in jail you'll be there 10 years and wake up one day and say
I shouldn't
put yourself there because you 've never brought up in 10 equal
you always bring up in 10. you always bring up due process along first-hand
Witnesses one is a war rant I wrote this down yesterday
more rent that's an act of War
thank you what makes it a lawful warrant
nine times out of I'd say 99 times out of a hundred they don't have a legal one
pull a cigarette lighter out of your pocket and light their order on fire right in front of them something down on the thing walk back in your house
there's no wedding signature from a judge there's no raised seal from an
article three chord there's no claim or affidavit or
first-hand testimony support of your deal for the penalty of perjury backing up the warrant
half of the time the warrant doesn't show the exact place
to be searched and an item to be seized their general ones
they gotta say we know you have a firearm that's illegal
and it is in your bedroom and that's where they get to go on they
don't go look at your kitchen they get to go to your bedroom
if they've got all that sworn affidavit and everything is proper water the way you can referencing it and I know that's
what consists of more but what do you say no we'll get up here where is the here
they don't have anything they have no Authority they're private for-profit business
an entity pretending and acting as Government
they're de facto figures out a hundred times I've said it
lots and lots of times I've said it to people individually on the phone 20 30 times
and one day they called me said David you're right I looked this up these guys are all
private for-profit businesses Dave Jose was one he had no idea I I said why
don't you do have I'll give you an assignment Dave go around to all the courthouses in Maryland
and find me an actual quarter of record
Dave and Sergio drove around all day to all the different courthouses
at it I think it's 201 East Jefferson Street
you found an actual equipment oh really
yeah can you please tell me the difference between the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution
yeah almost uh
for the corporations in 1789 and the other was written for the corporation
1871 but changed the corporation
of in four and then they added some remembrance
the first constitution had 13.
the students first constitution at 13 11. so that person
the second one which is that one yeah it's all 14 citizen yeah
that's great thanks yeah and that one the 13th Amendment is not the 13th Amendment
in this one the 13th amendment freed the black slaves in the 14th Amendment office
enabling Concetta would never previously as it hadn't been up to me
he wasn't talking about the color of their skin yeah like a white listed has nothing to
do with his status not a color yeah so
what is fifth most important word in the law
it's another pink improved previously
the previously when you do your Affidavit of repudiation in your data where you could
be this you've gotten an activity and any other documents you want to do that happens to show your intent
and you've done them previously to a court case anything previously done in the law is a
subtle matter now you can say judge this has already been adjudicated
about this it's previously settled better
her traps back on things in their path
in their path they throw it's full of bear traps in London lines
so previously
foreign
dog here told me something pretty cool yesterday
body reacts to truth our energy reacts to truth
exactly Universal Church
resonance and Improvement he was absolutely right
had been there their process
they have a motto that says no Factor Church shall be tried to court that's it over and over again
they don't need the fastest they don't need the tree they don't need firsthand evidence
they don't have any first-hand Witnesses they don't even need the proper one
foreign agreement they use hearsay to convince you they
presume and assume you don't you you don't do anything about it and you
actually is I'm going to spell hours
you accept if you don't repot it you accept
so everything else is objection you object to every word that comes out
of the prosecutors that's a lot
when they ask why what's your reason for our objection is just say hearsay sure
where's the firsthand Witness or is he intended to commit a current
look at what I've done previously okay
if if somebody does nothing it's like the story I told yesterday of a kid who would held against the wall until he was
choked out with the gun all that attorney did is objected to
everything the prosecutor said the jury deliberated for just a couple of minutes about a minister of all churches
because this the state did not curb your cape the case you're honored that's what the jury Master said
Improvement the case because of every word that came out of the prosecutors announced what was objected to on the
record yeah but the judge can either allow it or not allow it so you know the
judge is objected to properly colossal no not if the judge doesn't feel like it
not if it's not a proper judge Family Court well there's a jury
yeah well that's different okay
math lessons over those are pretty much all the basics you'll ever needed in any case
stud y I don't think it's that complicated when you get into the complicated
details of your case you'll probably lose
this amount dog bites the neighbor
sues the dog owner of the dog bite clients
life-threatening injuries yeah that happens hold on let's listen
let's listen to what he has to say hold on just as a scratch on her ankle
up walking in two days and shorts jogging down to her mailbox my threading
injuries yeah go to go to the pound there's a
she runs across the parking lot while the police put their dog down at the
pound life-threat these injuries huh how long was she in the emergency room
for four hours because that's what it takes for the common cold to get through here an emergency room ready
to walk in there with anything it takes four hours standard operating procedure for
him okay this is an actual case that I saw happening to one of my neighbors
she sued and she won for 121 thousand dollars because they killed her dog or the
person that got bit the person that got bit sued the owner got 121 thousand
dollars for my name and then I started teaching my neighbor
the law she went back and avoided the whole thing and got the money back
isn't that where the insurance company kicks in Pays it and then UPS your insurance or cancels you is that what
happened money though for the insurance company so that she didn't get a Nick on her insurance
actually a shield allowed five thousand dollars
that's awesome that's powerful stuff so anyway all kinds of things could happen but if
you know of just the very very basis you can win over and over and over again
lose if you let him run over the top again this is this is after
um you're already in court at this point so
you've already you've already played you're already part of the game and
definitely you said in your notice of appearances
they're very special appearance you have the accepted jurisdiction that's what special appearance means right okay
General appearance even accepted jurisdiction a special appearance you have no circumventing Arena right okay
if you just if you just ignore it all and you don't feel it you're going to put a warm
Radice out for you they're going to declare war they're going to come in with guns they're going
to pick you up and throw you in a box with the ground walls is marked
what was the closest one
to create this visual insurance you know just some appearance is the first document you ever thought
an error of Korean Novus says Hey Court you're making a critical error here you
sent this to some entity that's not me yeah
foreign Court foreign jurisdiction
here
but i tried to find figure out how to spell irrigatory and couldn't find it
is what one nation sends to another nation when someone has broken their laws
can i send you something so can i send this to the bar member that i have an issue with
and it's 25 questions you said 26 i can throw it out no no not even
answered yep most people can't think of 25.
should i work really hard on on fred business and i got i came up with 21 answers 22 questions
it's hardcore well at that point are you doing the presumptions of the court
in that too
okay so what it is is part of discovery it's part of your discovery process the
letter derogatory is part describes discovery what proof in truth in fact in evidence
do you have that eye safe question
there they're really cool and a real good way to trap them into a corner
a lot of questions they can't answer and i would also hope that someone else is special sure it's called the next
friend what's our brand of the core
procedures where i always fall apart so
i gotta stop by
so uh
errors don't make these critical errors
now you can do rf notice and fill out what critical errors you think you're making or do that in here
yeah it's a fact of truth and evidence that's an affidavit then correct
one more time sorry but i'm sorry that's okay the fact of truth and evidence letter
is that that comes after that is that an affidavit yes okay you what you want to do is you want
to build a timeline of events so at 401 pm on september 7th
police officer named blah blah blah shows up in my house right this is the questions he asks this
is how his answer he left
a week later i get an email from child protective services okay
so he did left he did his report he turned it into child protective services
child protective services says an email saying we want to come over and inspect
your house there's been a complaint or an allegation
and you just keep track of every communication every interaction
every time they show up your house you keep a running
chronological order of the truth and the facts of whatever that happened
and you put them down and now today if it's an email print it off write
exhibit number one and in your affidavit you say
i received this email on this date and this time see attached exhibit number one
the next time it's seed attached exhibit number two on and off you keep it all and you just
start building this case of truth because they're gonna come in with their path of lies and they're
going to build up lies you're going to build up a stack of truth they're going to build up a stack of lies
and who's going to win if you ever have to go to a higher court the truth will prevail okay but i was
also told that the affidavits of truth and evidence to keep them simple because if one fact is found to be wrong
if they could if they prove one fact wrong the entire document is wrong no in caffeinated they must rebut
point by point that is the law so if one's wrong they can refund one point they can send you a letter
that says on your affidavit item number 14. oh i was told that it's
all my paralegal that's doing my affidavit right that we're doing my actions right now
whatever that's good
i just have to say that okay so anymore
um where can i find that is there in about 100 places
west law just yet cornell okay you had to do this
you told me you would want to keep it really simple and and not detailed but very general but if
that's our our facts okay i've seen michelle's 20
that's terrible
pretty funny
not fun talking about michael anyway
[Music] he was a pretty good football player in high school
well somebody put out there's 500 thousand dollars on the table if you can find a picture if you're pregnant with
those girls yeah
[Music] should have a red sharpie fine tip
sharpie a purple pen and then i like good old blood
so i just stick my fingers
does anyone else want to write down their email address yes
this has a spider on it oh yeah that's it isn't that cute no it's it's it's from
it's spider company yeah it's a big ski company
i put my ride in helmet on yesterday and there was a little spider this big right next to it
it got killed i've been bitten i had to go get the broom so i could
only kill very poisonous and you them go get this do you guys have those and how did you
do that i got that special they're not native they come with a special stuff um i just i went to the hospital
can't you just use the red stamp
my name is david lester my mom gave me this day
my dad gave me that because my dad's brother's name was this and my mom thought i was a kid
well you were angry this is a familiar name
this joins your given names this is a full stop colon
says hey wait a minute my name is dave luster stop end of sims
[Music]
let's say i don't want the aurora anymore but i want to use my middle name captain and so laura like how much does it cost to like
legally change your name
that means i the man living thank you
okay what's before the david again what's a colon
full colon a full coleman say it's
important
you don't have any choice in that
for the name there was a semicolon in between the middle and the last and
there were two commas after at the end because you eventually learned
more and more i studied the chicago styles manual probably 15 or 20 years
then over time i just kind of do what let it go read it so much
you're researching so much you just forget then i went back to the chicago style
manual this is the problem okay so should i
change it in that style that's chicago stuff chicago styles
proper english so should i change it in that empty affidavit where my name is
make it like that instead it's just like
okay can you tell what was the significance of the two panels
was there or was that just okay because when i when i did minecraft
i just printed it out the other day i did only put one comma and i took the two out because i wasn't since i didn't know it was okay thank
you also i didn't think i did that so get that directly from here
i think i got it off kirk's law group okay is that okay or they shouldn't have sure
it just got handed down by somebody else i wasn't going to use it without asking for permission
well i don't care it's out there see the thing about an affidavit is this
you have to make it your own you it is yours you're swearing to it under the penalty of
persian the minute you put your name on it's not mine no matter what it is it's yours you better know what's in it
because you might get questioned understand what's in it you need to know what it says what
the words mean every paragraph that's a lot of creating that they need
yeah what that was designed to do is be a last ditch effort when you've
lost all hope you follow the never perfect afternoon you've lost
all of it because that comes into the court very strongly and they look at that
and they may call it all kinds of things and try and underwrite it and stuff but they read it and people
want you to understand something now they say oh we're not going to pay
any attention to your documents hey we're not going to do this we're not going to do that don't kid yourself they read
every document and they do not want to admit
certain things so if you're told something that's true and honest about you and
you don't want to admit that what do you do you run over the top of it somewhere
you try and skate around it you do whatever it takes not to admit it that's what the court's
doing with your documents we're calling the court out we're calling the government out
we're calling the monetary system out we're calling every bit of the fraud out in that
99-page document okay they're not going to admit to
they're gonna if they admitted to it oh my god they'd be open to some of the biggest losses in the
history of mankind probably but what it does is they read it and
they go holy crap we got to do something how can we get out of this
so um i'm only have it printed and i was instructed by robert doyle to
only use it as a get out of jail free card so that's the only reason i have it my one phone call if i get thrown in jail
will be to a friend that knows where it's at she's to file it with the court and they'll get me out of jail
that's why that's what i'm using it for it was designed for parents that have been gone for
years their kids have been removed for years and years they've tried everything
nothing's working they've been tpr now what do you do don't you play bad
yeah that's how i fight back you call out the fraud you expose them how do you expose them there's 99 pages
of exposure right there okay if nothing else learn it use it as a teaching
and learning tool there is so much knowledge in that 99 pages it's amazing
i wrote a document several years back called a never perfect affidavit and the
reason i named it that because for four or five years i just kept
making it better to make it better how to do it changing it and making it better so this
white master never perfect never will be perfect you're always going to learn new things if it's perfect i'm dead so
you know so it's it's literally 99 pages of education calling them out
for the fraud
yeah i mean you could learn so much just it ought to be taken out of affidavit
form a book make it a book yeah put it on amazon sell it no it's an
amazing piece of work earlier there's so much education i mean that's why i could never present it on purpose to the court
because i don't have time to read all that stuff that you have in there to research it all to know where it comes from but for an emergency i'll use it
hundreds of places
because if you use a first thing you're going to
it was never designed to be a first and only document
it was designed as a nuclear option so notice of appearances first okay error
of course put a long notice that they're in the air or
doing your affidavit your letter of derogatory all those things can be done first
the most important thing we can learn is handle things before anything happens you get a letter in the mail to your all
caps name from somebody get it taken care of
within 72 hours first don't throw it on the fridge and
forget about it or put it in the drawer and forget about it now because then the problem just does
pretty soon you're gonna do it you know more people get in trouble by procrastination
that they get by just handling something
or anything else i come home to a kid i've been gone for three months you know tickets all over my stuff so what did
you do these tickets while you were away
then you do an affidavit that says i arrived home on such and such a day to start the start to
on the day you left
okay credit card company let's just say you
got a credit card right maybe you're 19.
a lot of 19 year old students got a credit card year 19 and had a 500 limit
some other things and you run it up to the 200 ballots and they send you
your first invoice in the mail to your all caps
you take the invoice and stick it on your fridge with the magnet you sail it worry about that later
can you forget about it you open the fridge a half a million times between you and then and you can't seem
to see that thing on your fridge
30 days goes by right 30 days goes by i send you past
it's the same invoice it just says now it's passed due right you got 15 days
you don't pay it within 15 days you stick that past you notice on top of the other one on your bridge and you forget
about it he's done that before okay
they send you a default
in ten days
then you got this 200 bill you no longer have the credit limit you know 240 on it now right
and you're in default i said that sounds screw you i'm not paying
it right so what do you do what happens you got 10
only if you know that which nobody does at 19. okay
starts the clock
that paper because i i did that stupid credit cards crap and my parents that i feel was
wrong on their part they cleared this late for me they paid all my credit card debt and then they started me from scratch
yeah they should
so anyway this starts the clock over at 15 10.
now they can follow
now in the beginning of the credit card somewhere in here before this first
30-day period they sent you backer terms
and conditions you had 72 hours
to refuse the terms and conditions or alter them and change them that did
one in court that guy
we're cancelling your credit line okay it's up to them they can respond to your
response that is banking process
well guess what every court is a bank
every judge is a baker got that black's law
you look up the word judge it says c banker c postmaster you look up the word court
it says c bank c post office all courts were set up as united states
district postal courts benjamin franklin set up the post office
as a bank all courts are banks all courts are operating in congress all
crimes are commerce since 1934 even mr
so your first answer they send you something you answer you've got 30 days
to answer you send them something they got 30 days to answer
the second time they got 15 days to answer the third time they got 10 days to
answer now an affidavit is going to be a little bit different
notice an initial notice process is 21 days
that's why you got to publish things for 21 days okay affidavit your first affidavit is
21 days and treat all affidavits as 21 minutes
now other than that there is nothing that's how courts
operate there's only two things without statute
limitations
that's it you can be 20 years into a life sentence
challenge jurisdiction fraud and prove it and then you walk out the door
doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you went through all that appeal process one day you're sitting in prison and you
wake up and said holy crap i just realized this was all prof
the day you recognize promise the day the wheel falls off the wagon and avoids everything from the beginning
all you got to do is prove it challenge jurisdiction expose the fraud and get out of jail
not that any of you were going to go to jail right okay but i'm not teaching it just for
you teaching the teachers you're about to teach everybody
someday i'm going to get tired go
fishing
yeah so once you once you've got this basic process of how all bills work
what is an indictment the indictment is a true bill
7 right on every indictment this is a true bill how many people get an indictment and
say okay how much is the bill
they don't nobody does and if they did the court court would scare the heck out of them
because appeal some might be two million dollars
that's why they don't put the amount on the bill scare people okay a true bill
[Music] it's an invoice
you don't ask how much it doesn't say and you so you put it on the fridge and
you forget about it so they bring you up on charges you
can't pay the charges you're asked to bond can't pay the bond your body sell assured you print them on when you're put in
jail well they collect on your asses to keep you trust and they pay off the debts
for the commercial crime of columns
what you understand is this simple you start looking at everything a little bit differently
and that's the key to look at this stuff differently most people get an indictment fail and
they're crying curled up in a corner in the fetal position and they're wondering what they're going to do
and they're in the phone book looking for the best attorney they can afford and they go on two or three
you know free consultations they find out they can't afford any of them
so anyway so what do you do let's say for instance
[Music]
the reason they suspend is that you actually have one it's just unusable when you have one
you're still in commerce you're still in contrast
yeah you go get a stock to get an additional fine
but you can't just ignore it and leave it in suspension because it'll stay in suspension forever
then
and i could get divorced and as far as the state's concerned i'm still married
that lives on in perpetuity you have to involve a bearish jesus
structure you were never really married and you're never really divorced until you go to puerto rico and fix it that's where they keep their records and
they'll mail him a 10-page document in spanish and that'll really freak him out
pat and trademark goddess states patented the marriage process
the blueprint of that package is right there on the board real simple little blueprint the state
is the primary contract
it's at the top of the pyramid they join with the husband in other
words the state marries the husband
the state end joins with the wife
there's no line connecting the husband and the wife it's broken a
dashed line is a beam that bears no weight
they put god's name on the beam that bears no way it bears no way to contract they took
god out of the picture you married the state
oh gosh so when they deal with things it deals with
everything through the state when you deal with your wildlife
[Music]
i think i sent you
i was trying to mean
an enlightening conversation with the marriage bureau
about 20 years ago my former wife filed for divorce we had seven children five daughters two sons our youngest at the
time our second son was five years old at the time i prepared a counter claim to the petition for dissolution per
attorney filed in domestic relations court i met one afternoon with the head of the maricopa county superior court marriage
license bureau in downtown phoenix the marriage license bureau was headed by a young woman of about age
25. i asked her to explain to me the general and statutory implications of the marriage license
she was very cooperative and called in an assistant a tall black man who at the time was
working on an operations manual for the internal department use
of the agency she deferred for most technical explanations to her assistant
he walked through the technicalities of the marriage license as it operates in arizona you mentioned
that marriage licensing is pretty much the same in the other states but there are a few minor differences
one significant difference he mentioned was that arizona is one of eight western states that are community property
states the other states are common law states like utah with the exceptional louisiana
which is a napoleonic code state
okay he then explains some of the technicalities of the marriage license he said
first of all the marriage license is secular contract between the parties and the state
the state is the principal party in that secular contract
the husband and wife are secondary or inferior parties the secular contract is a three-way
contract between the status principal and the husband and the wife has the
other two links in the contract he said in the traditional sense marriage is a covenant
between the husband and wife and god but in the secular contract with the state
reference to god is on a dotted line and not officially considered included in the secular contract
at all he said that if the husband and wife wish to include god as a party in
their marriage that is a dotted line they will have to add in their own minds
the state's marriage license is strictly secular he said further that what he meant by
the relationship to god being a dotted line that the state regards any mention of god as heir rebel
fear revlon even meaningless in his description of the marriage license
contract the related one to the other is a dotted line
there's no direct line between the husband and wife
anyway i'm not going to read this whole thing you guys can read it later but this is right in the
united states patent trademark office blueprint
so in my talks my training classes i teach people the proper way to get married
for about forty dollars online you can buy a family bible and it's got some blank pages in the
front they all say holy bible at the top
there's a whole bunch of lines on these blank pages you create the event the date the time
the place who officiated it the husband and wife's name and i don't use the term
husband and wife but mate and healthy
i like it then you get
three witnesses to sign it you take that and you go record it
you take a picture of it sign a little laugh david we got married this time these places via the bible between us
and god go record it on land now the state of alabama heard one of my presentations
that i gave to the 10th amendment society down there and it went before the legislature and
the lawmakers eliminated marriage license from the
city they removed them
and now they tell you to go get married in the bible and bring it to a probate judge the
probate judge will make sure all the documentation is filled out properly and properly recorded
okay very simple things these are things we all should be doing
it doesn't have to be the holy bible there's freedom of religion in this country
and as much as i hate to say it i prompt for that you can use the koran if you want
offer people's right to choose but we're a christian nation found in
christian principles and the jewish bible is just as christian and more and more so than any
other bible okay so don't tell people
done proper way to get married every
15 16 17 year old on earth needs to be taught this right here just
this little this is it what i challenge you guys to do
is develop little five minute napkin presentations
so i'm gonna tell you what that means december of 1988 i sold an advertising
agency that i had started and i started the financial planning for securities license mortgage license
insurance license i mean and i just
did it big i went out i rented a whole entire floor second floor of this huge office
building on a cruise way into portland lake oswego which is the financial district in the west
and i hired over 100 sales people and i said
a great way to get started in sales is to sell mutual funds very easy to sell all these sales put
people went out and they were having a hard time selling a hard time making their commissions the
money they need to live on so i developed a 10 minute napkin presentation
and basically this 10 minute napkin presentation
basically showed how you a husband and wife
could bypass these middlemen go directly into the american economy
and invest their money and instead of making five percent with these guys
back then that was about average now it's 0.25
you could take your money and go right around directly in an american economy through a mutual
fund company dipper which automatically diversifies your money into the american economy
and you can make ten to fifteen percent
how does that foreign to you
i could give that presentation to a husband and wife in a restaurant and i was selling hundreds of thousands
of dollars with the mutual funds within home i did open that
now presentation and i taught all hundreds of my sales people and we sold so many mutual funds out of
that office that we got the attention of sanford wilde
do you know who sandy weil is he's gonna start years later with forty thousand
tomorrow money he sold seven years later to american express for a billion
and then he became the ceo of american express as part of the deal
then he became a ceo of citibank primerica many mutual fund companies
and i sold so much he got his attention and he flew out in his private 707. how many people have it
privates boeing 707. yeah that's about it okay not very many
he picks me up he blinds me to new york city and he puts me up in the waldorf astoria and every day for about four
days a limo would come pick me up take me to a recording studio
over and over and over again until we got it perfect i was a 26 year old kid
i got that napkin presentation now and they used it to train city bank
employees for years in fact a gal i went to high school with
clement orlando ford called me just about five or six years ago it said
david i had no idea you even did this but i just watched a video citibank
training video of you doing a presentation on how to sell neutral
so from 1980 i think it was 1990 when i did that that city big thing
until six years ago they've been using it that long that brought to me
the other thing he did is done with that presentation in new york he says have you ever gone to a
national association of financial planners convention i said no i didn't even
he goes i'd like you to speak at it and do your napkin presentation
and i said okay what is it he says well we're going to leave right now
and he's twisting on his 707 and flies me to the
tacoma
and when i walk up on stage to get this presentation and my face turn around there's my face
on a tv screen 40 feet tall so they could see it in the
nosebleed sections and it was in for 40 000
that's the scariest thing i've ever seen for a 26 year old kid
well i got he gave me 30 minutes to do it i had a 30 minute slot to build and i
was done at 15. now what do i talk about i have no idea
you gotta understand that was my first public speaking appearance
fail yeah i failed speech it was my first step in the history of my school year school
life it was my first step because i hated getting up in front of a group so badly
and here i am at this point with me looking over my shoulder
yeah it was weird really so anyway what i'm saying with this
story is develop little napkin presentations
that you can sit down with somebody and teach them you can sit down with a 16 year old draw this out
and explain it just like i did and show them the proper way to get married
what would happen in the united states if the vast majority of people get married weren't getting a marriage
license what kind of changes would that make
huge changes [Music]
that's right yes so take every little aspect of this business of learning and create a little simple
your own napkin presentation that you can give in 10 or 15 minutes
and this is how you can teach people especially the young people in need i mean look at all of us in here over a
morning
you see what i mean why don't we have a bunch of 15 16 year olds in this
but if you're 15 or 16 years old you just brought your boyfriend home for the first time to
your parents and the parents sat down with you and said if you guys ever plan to get
married i hope they don't do that on the first time they bring them home but if you ever plan on getting married
here's how it really works and here's how it should what do you think
i feel that most people
because the name of her book was you know something is wrong
and she wrote it designed to teach children that's why it's fully you know full drives right
you know something is wrong with i think everybody feels that everybody
knows there's something wrong they just don't know what it is they can't put their finger on it
a lot of guys have done it but if you can develop something that you can in a in a restaurant on the back of a
napkin or on the back of a table placement i had a couple come down who just lost their
kids up in washington state and they drove all the way to bed i didn't even know they were coming
they called me up at nine o'clock in the morning and said david are you in bed and i said yeah they said well we're in
bed too we're just visiting our kids
you got any time to me i really didn't but they said we drove all the way down
from washington to see you i'd like to meet with you so i said all
right i'll i'll make some time for you between 11 and 3.
we went to black bear diner arrester blackbeard diner has those paper placemats you know
the 200 year plays on three of those placements in three hours
i taught them a whole bunch of stuff just like this the very basics of law
what's going on how to do it and what documents to file i sat there with my ipad and sent them emails right from
there of the different documents that they could go home and change and about a month later they called me
up and said dude thank you
if we can get good enough to do that over and over and over again think of how many people we can do
it's just developing these little tiny things these little napkins presentations
you know do one on traffic tickets whatever the majority of people get in
trouble for the first time their first event was
so go through and develop these little presentations that can teach me
and then you can teach everybody else and that's what's important it's not just about us in the real world it's about making it teach it
quickly you can only teach so many people but if
i can teach a hundred people and those hundreds can go out and teach a hundred each and they can teach at their age
now pretty soon we woke up a nation
yeah that's the goal we've got less than 1300 days left
and really that's all we have i
never would have thought that 10 years ago but i've studied enough to know that
i've seen things come true over and over and over again that were written by them so how shall i not believe
[Applause]
but it is it's really quite simple if i can do it on this
pattern here in front of the groove you guys can do it
and make it what's that and that made the book out everybody asked me how could you know
right above well because i can't sit long enough to write that book now the son who's a writer and
i've asked him to write a book about it and i was hoping he had learned while he's writing a book
you know but he can't find time to write the book
i know everybody learns different ways i'll tell you what you tell me something i'm going to forget it to happen
if i read it i'll remember it for life
and it's true everybody everybody has a different method of learning
[Music]
yeah it's really simple because little things are really simple presumption assumption to house
agreement here's and learn to repeat them over and over so what do you need help with ask
questions
you know the state of texas actually issues an american state national license plate yeah
and very few people even know that for american state nationals so you can buy it it's an actual
state-issued plan and it never has to be renewed never have to buy tags
every state is supposed to under the u.s department of transportation guidelines regulation c all states are
supposed to provide us with a republic form of government and a sovereign plate
oregon has oregon listed on their website and they say you can get it
here here and here three locations all three locations are
in salem which is the capital city of oregon
one is the main office of the state's department of motor vehicles division
i called somebody that i knew that i went to high school with that worked there in that office for 35 years and we just
retired she'd never heard of that in fact she went off on me there's no such
thing scroll up and down and so i just got it off your website it says contact one of these three
places here it is i sent her a screenshot of the website
she goes 30 35 years i was there never heard since
they've never seen one don't know anything about it but you're right it's right here
on our website so i call the next one the next one is an oregon department of
transportation website or uh location
whatever you want to call it and he said you know i've been here about 20 years and i
remember seeing a couple of those plays i'm on a shelf somewhere
i can see if i can find them i can see if i can find them i should agree thank you i
appreciate that see if you can find one and here's my phone number call me back
two days later he calls me back sorry buddy i couldn't buy it i couldn't
find it anymore the other one was a department of transportation's website
they said yeah we got the machinery and everything to make one of those but i don't i don't think we've fired it up in 15 or
20 years i'm not sure i know how
did you get into it no he gave me somebody else to talk to
and they gave me somebody else to talk to they'd give me somebody else to talk to you
and i said screw this we ought to just see this data we're going to make
yeah regular election z place the u.s department of transportation says states are required to issue red z
planes there's a lot of people that do them in the private market that sell them for this purpose but then you've got to know what you're doing to back it
up you know yeah because a lot of them get arrested to put it on their cars well they just slap it on and think i'm done you know
there's more to it um yeah it's called the mso and the mcu right
no questions
notice of appearance are our core movements and our notice of service i understand
what they are i don't understand their application and i don't understand their concept so you'd have to see them to understand
that okay your notice
that's an american state national you're not a citizen person essentially that's where it is okay
says yeah i'll show up in court to settle this pattern but only under these conditions
can you wait for
sometimes just on a notice of appearance that remove your court date it's not worth their effort
eventually they do give up and then you're truly free and you drive down the road you're talking on your cell phone and not
putting your turn signals on and pretty soon you know
cops are just leaving me alone waving at you yeah and for
well the nuts serious are the like the silly thing that we were talking about you were talking about
just basically the way that you were talking about the game so 72 hours
like i did with that registration ticket i just right here offered a contract that's not accepted right
and maybe if you're actually traveling while traveling and
private my brother
yes title 18 section 242 you're operating under the killer law
once you do that they go they know they're operating in color
laws you want to have fun go see your county attorney say mr county
attorney mine's name is dave doyle i've done this to you many times i like dave
hey did you just say that i sat down with dave doyle and i spent about three hours going through this stuff with it
and it says how do you guys feel about that and he says honestly i'm just applying
my time so i can retire that's what he told
he says i don't know about 40 percent of all the lawsuits issues getting his law losses i said good i've been
teaching the people that's awesome forty percent of all the losses
deschutes county district colorado
people are calling them out on it well that's what it is
now we've got a couple of brand new judges that are just pure hell on meals you know for themselves
point i don't know judges seem to get into office and they seem to run unopposed
[Music]
[Music]
jurisdictions what is the law who has to make it me when i can walk between jurisdictions
back and forth whenever i want to and not end up in jail that's how you
know you're free all these patriot groups man they want out of admiralty and they want to jump
into common law with both feet
donald give you one jurisdiction see that's what i tell them
no but if we have dominion then why do we have to get on the ship if they want to be bullies to us why do we have to why can't we say no
don't bully me i'm not getting on your show you don't the answer to that is you don't the the
other answer to that is they've been getting away with it for a hundred and fifty so this way we just need to we
need to fight we just need to go on their ship and just like take them off we have to correct the errors or public
servants are making the only way to do that is to get on their ship and let them know yeah and educate them so they never do
it again yeah you got to get on board and educate
that's why i say that's our only two jobs the rest time
anyone this is this is one of the big reasons for the terminology is being
misused sovereign citizen is because those guys that are practicing
sovereign citizen bologna because they are not
calling them out on their own ship once they call them out on their own
ship then they're free they have dominion so who are these sour and citizen people what are they doing
well lots of people that learned about this this way to make people like they're like obama make people
think they're sovereign and free but they're really not easy when we follow the steps i've taught you
this class and you've done the proper documentation you've got the proper paperwork
and you learn how to walk between jurisdictions you're a soccer you're as good as zucchini well what's the sovereign citizen the term was
invented just like conspiracy theorists yes it was something to put on you and instantly dismiss anything that comes
out of your mouth next so when a cop says you saw from citizen i say are you a yeah like you
can't be sovereign oh so it's to make us sound like a conspiracy theorist yeah it's like randy
doesn't mean it's a creative title okay dismiss you right away if you think about it you can't be
sovereign exactly so i'd say no i'm not a society
the power and authority and they're taught they're tied up talking about
if you use that term they're like oh great you point yourself out for me they know them by their olympic
yeah yeah everything i always think of the movie men in black
want to think of fbi don't those guys you know poppy aliens
look like fbi agents i'll dress pristine right
and that's the problem with small groups with big groups we'd say hold your questions after i can get up there and do the
whole thing rattle it all off but when i get interrupted a lot then it goes
i think was it a sovereign citizen question that he asked that you were on the board what was it
the last question that was asked was oh no i was doing the uh the question was this notice of service
and uh
okay that's what it was thank you good job i'd write everything down
my i claim bob smith
whoever he is trespassed yeah maybe
and then you just small explanation of how he trespassed against
he stole my kids he came showed up at my house kicked my door and took my two kids and he left therefore he committed
kidnapping
and you can come up with a whole list of crimes on the united states code that he committed probably 130 felonies or more
they carry quarter of a million dollar fines for each count and up to 10 years of prison for
each count and there's more than that probably
there's hundreds if you read the entire united states code you can come up with hundreds
that they our public servants commit against us trying to get us for a misdemeanor
and they're committing hundreds of felonies to do it but we don't hold an account so this is
how you hold it accountable
and you just keep it simple you file the initial claim then you can go in and expand on
it but you just get the initial claim files a one-page claim document
explaining a little bit about what he did calling for a grand jury or a prosecutor to
prosecute so you list the crimes you call right or prosecuted
for because they can't prosecution no why
not
here's one of the problems with our justice system of america today is that the prosecutor runs the
grandeur no defense evidence is heard no defense witnesses
is heard the prosecutor goes in front of the grand jury unless he says i think we've got enough evidence to convict this guy here it is
what do you think grand jury says that looks like you got a case here they
sign off on you get an indictment not a bit of defense evidence is there at all
to prove that you're interested they just walk all over the grand jury
therefore the grand jurial indicted ham sandwiches the prosecutor tells him
then somebody gives a warrant an indictment is warrant for their arrest gets picked up they get thrown in jail
maybe it's two three four five months sometimes a year before they even get to trial
and they've lost their job they've lost their home they lost their family they lost their wife
their their cars have been repossessed because they didn't make the payments for three months on and on their life just gets
absolutely destroyed then they go to trial and the the guy stands up there and he says judge
where's my intent to commit a crime where's my first hand witnesses i'm here by special appearance he does
everything right he's found the innocent and he gets to walk out the door
so what yeah right why can't he do that in the beginning
when in front of the grand jury why doesn't he get to stay his case because that's one of the
problems ever since we became an administrative corps process 1934
this grand jury is far public it's how you say jury trial you won there's two different ways you want a
trial by jury not a jury trial
a trial by jury means when the jury is done making their decision it's final
paul's judge does a sentence he's a disinterested third party on a jury
trial the jury can deliberately make a decision the judge can override it
okay
i don't understand why that guy went to jail oh the grand jury let's stick with this for just a second
you call for prosecution what happens is the prosecutor says i don't think we have enough processing okay
uh we don't want to we don't want to prosper it's up to them they've got to they can
make that decision they want well now here's where you're in the united states code becomes your friend
again because if you give the government an opportunity to prosecute you call for
prosecution and they say no now you can do it yourself
you become the prosecutor you call your corpse
but you have to give them the opportunity first to prosecute on your behalf
that's that's a real key right here in holding these guys account
timeline of what went on how did bob smith hurt you and trespass against you
your affidavit follows up your claim your claim is just a one-piece document
it says i david street claimed bob's been trespassed against me he committed this crime this christmas
crime this crime in this grave will you please prosecute
i'm prepared for trial something like that theory is to
prosecute and then you do the same exact thing against the prosecutor showing how he trespassed against you now he's got problems too
if they refuse to prosecute the united states code says you can prosecute so now you call your own court from the
court clerk you demand your own court they supply the judge you're the prosecutor you get bob smith
up on the stand you get yourself they still get the judge to make the decision
uh they still get the judge to make the decision you can call it you're a trump ledger
your courthouse is your building i love the trial i thought the jury was only for the
defendant
almost always the defendant will go forward he just goes along with it
so you can call for arbitration if you want you can do whatever you want at that
point it's yours
you first have to make a claim
so anyway what's next
okay there there is a court out there that not too many people know about
and it's important that i have recently been studying all their laws
and their rules and stuff just recently and have been going through court cases
that go through this court and trying to figure out how we can use this core
and i'm starting to see this court as a key to a lot of the things that we want to
accomplish i think we can use this court to stop all force vaccinations
every building has a toilet every corpus has a torment
this is the environmental core and when i'm reading these cases i've seen where people have
used
petition for a great bread of habeas corporates of rosario island continuing
extraordinary writ of execution to environmental martial service
the environmental court has an environmental martial service i
didn't know that existed until not too long so i've been studying
this trying to learn continuing this action or extraordinary
rhythm mandavis to the united states washington service a writ of assistance to the united
states marshals a writ of precipitation of clerk of courts a written restitution to
the secretary of the united states treasury for rosario iowa
this court is extremely powerful and it can make the way it was set up
the way this whole thing was set up was a huge police force
for international environmental law and the united states runs non-reason
why don't we hear about this on the news what do we know anything why a buy who's
been involved in this stuff since 1989
why have i not heard about the environmental court until 2019
30 years later is this under maritime law or is it
international so it's not part of it's not
oh
so
when you go through these cases what you're finding is that every thing is
a chemical biological warfare agent these bad things including
vaccines are chemical warfare under international
law very legal they break
every law that there is in environmental court regulators i mean i can't find anything that is not
broken there are acts of war trafficking kidnapping and fraud is
involved i mean he he's this guy is her lady guy who is
we need to figure this out in fast because i think it can stop all
these problems when you're going through and reading these different core cases and i download some of the
blank forms and all kinds of stuff problems they are
i don't know what to say i mean there's so many laws the environmental court was established by an act of congress on
october 18 1972. it was public law 92 500 that established it
the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1972 section 9 of the environmental court
is authorized by the united states judiciary act title 28 of the united states code section 1651
to issue all rights necessary or appropriate in the aid of its respective
jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law amendment articles nine and ten of the
bill of rights bound under the constitution governs these rights
sovereign powers retained by the people of the united states
the environmental court is a district court authorized by congress
as defined under public law 92 500 section 2 federal water pollution control act
citizen suits can be brought to the environmental corn
section 5058 okay so telling me the section says say
is allowed having original jurisdiction and final authority over all
international venues to include the above decline venue and persons located
on the continent of the americas under 505 a guaranteed amendment article
11 immunity to all citizens all citizens of americans of the
americas are immediate from these environmental protections
false everybody okay all everybody
the people of the united states appearing as a man rosario ivan
an american national without the united states
his guaranteed sovereign immunity on unalienable liberty as provided exclusively for american
nationals in amendment article 11 constitution of the united states of america of 1819
from trespasses by foreign military municipal personnel or agents of the united states
upon his sovereign immunity by unalienable rights of property to life and liberty
by the benevolent respondent vanessa l bryant doing business as a judge
within the united states trespass constitutes a gross violation of due
process law and affecting the good behavior standard of vanessa held bryant
judge whose only entitlement to old office is during good behavior so they're out
of honor
so anyway this is american state national who brought this case in front of the environment
he goes on and talks about establishes his jurisdiction
as you go through this he goes through his restraint of liberty
where he's respondent is in fact restraining and conspiring to further restrain the enabling full god-given
delivery so what he did was assume a judge
okay the people of the united states man
appearing as rosario wyman who is without the united states is not an enemy in the state
as described in the united states code title 15 commonly known as the training within
the act it is in fact at peace with everyone and everything
except the hearing defined kidnapper kidnapper is in fact restraining the
people of the united states based on invisible contracts all of which are adhesive contracts and
unconscionable through dc fraud in favor of consideration arising from unlawful practices
and policies executed under municipal military color of law or enrichments
like his word there was not now nor was there ever any above defined matter
brought by the kidnapper acting in conspiracy with foreign bar members officers of the court within the united
states any judiciable issues respondent is in fact
restraining the liberty of the partitioner under colorado law
and not under the foreign sovereign communities act under presumed agreements of assumption
where no debt in fact lies and where respondent has no insurable interest
he goes on to talk about restraint of liberty is unlawful i'm skipping a lot because i'm trying to
give you an idea of what it is without having to read this
okay he goes through and he explains that and then he talks about exhaustion of remedy he's
already been fighting this in court whiteness in our courts okay
and he's exhausted all remedy that's why you went to the environment
so he's got 20 30. 39
48 55
58 59 66
so he's been working on this okay conclusion petitioner knows of no other
course of action in the above defined incident matters except by issue of the great grid of abuse corpus and all
rights necessary appropriately environmental courts respective jurisdiction to rescue the people of the united
states from the torturous acts of tyranny by fraud upon the judge upon the court
that issue of the written for habeas corpus is fundamental to a collateral attack on the torturous
actions of the respondent and for a further judicial review of the criminal acts of the respondents
so he's he's bringing his case on behalf of the people
the issue of the rip rehabies corpus is fundamental to this collateral attack
for the environmental court a court authorized under the preamble of the constitution of 1787 amendment articles
9 and 10 established by an act of congress in 1972 and having the authority to issue all
rights necessary for appropriate aid respective jurisdictions agreeable to
the usages and principles of law under 28 usc
1651 and to not grant the issue of the great grit would be a suspension to rip
with and by prejudice and would work toward a pond petitioner a man and further for all federal state
and municipal police departments and elected officials collectively governing authorities operating within
the federal jurisdictional judicial district within which the property to be linked is located
refused to execute all lawful risks the property to be lean is him
his body
a suspension of the red with and by prejudice would work a further tort upon a petitioner a
fellow citizen and would be construed as collision and obstruction of justice complicit with
the respondent judge vanessa al bryant
when he signs this he signs i and american national rosario i've been beneficial owner
absolute and the other side petitioner on my own fundamental commercial liability and bond to a firm that i caused the
above application for the great written previous corpus to be filed in the international environmental court
and due to known the contents to be true correct and complete so once you go through
that main document is his exhibits this is where you learn what happened
and he shows from the metropolitan district commission
they looked up online what contaminants were in
the new grant water department so you look up your municipal wherever
you're at you can get the contaminants that are listed as toxic
out of your water you could probably say these better than me but this was
i'm gonna butcher it bro ditch methane
okay chloroform chromium dip bro mulch oral methane
trihalomethanes all kinds of these contaminants
hormones in the water
and it just goes on and on of different exhibits
nitrates nitrite
no way i could say that word something acid dibromethane chromium
chloroform barium chlorate chromium fluoride
all these toxic poisons that are in the water
vanitium
i mean on and on and on all these different water reports they use as exhibits
but here's a cool thing the environmental court researches to see if he's right
and they do an investigative report on criminal violations of the city water system and they go
through and they come out with a great little report
basically agreeing with everything he said
and this guy ends up wanting his case to make a long story short
then brought in the grand jury to arrest the judge
it is a criminal investigation on the judge arrester put
when he first brought his case to the very first case to before that judge if she would have
sided with him and said the city municipal water system would better clean up their water
she would have been popping but she did
yeah
after trying all those times in front of her to get stuff done
now i love that i think the chloroform disease carrying pathogens
stuff that they find in these reports toxic forages oh my god it makes you not want to drink
water water scares me to death in this community our office in scottsdale tested about
every brand follow water this one right here was one of two capacities
body or water that's one of two the best tests out of hundreds of different while
the water comes okay so if you're just going to costco and grab
cases of bottled water you know some of the waters that used to be the town is the best there yeah
i mean it's all right oh look at all the chemicals that they
they found far more chemicals in the water than when you look at this report after page
after page was fat and then water
we all want to drink more of yet it's one of the things that's killing us fast how did you find this
i had a guy say to me why don't you take those cases of
medical situations from child protective services and run them through the environmental
core i said american report never would have bothered that don't know much about it never really
had any experience with the case in the environmental core so i just started studying
but when you start to read some of these you realize that anything that comes in a hybrid every
needle in fact anyone that even sticks a hypothermic
healing you need to draw blood isn't that under the environmental laws
just to penetrate here now i'm not against blood draws i think
they can learn some good things from stronger blood you know that might help us save our
lives that's right that's right everything
that is is an environmental concern it's
it's even more than that
[Music] look at what the state of new york is doing right now pulling the kids
and saying you have to they're forcing vaccines this is a way to end all of them i
i strongly believe it's a key to one attack my daughter in california
is on this campus and all these kids they have to have the flu vaccine and
she doesn't say a word they've all gotten the flu she's been there two years she hasn't had the flu
she's going on the third year not been sick one day every friend she knows has been
very sick i remember that then they would say if they found out she didn't have it they've been brainwashed in the same
you're the one that gave it to us is what they'll tell her is that she's the one that gave it to them
i used to sneak what i would do is research the environment
[Music]
my body will fight it if you wouldn't do it
walmart will pay you 25 gift cards to get a flu shot i know if walmart's gonna pay me 25 bucks to get a shot that is
the last thing in the world that i ever entertained putting in my business
fascinations what other sorts of uh
throughout the country right now it's about ten percent of what it was two years ago
we weren't down that far we've stopped that much so the chemtrail
so our shop produces all kinds of aluminum scrap aluminum dust fluoride right you sweep
it up off the floors you wonder why i've got a little problem well
anyway they they called us to combine them and buy
all of our scraps and they take it up to the airport in portland and they grind it all up in powdered
form and they were added into jet fuel
that's right it's water our shots our air
i you could probably think of a million reasons to go to the environment
especially anything a doctor or hospital to force chemotherapy on our friend right christine
our grandson of course chemotherapy that's an environmental issue she can stop
okay
why isn't a marriage adult after divorce is sold
because it makes profit for the state
everything they do is for-profit business
i've been married enough have you had your marriages at home no
you have to go to puerto rico that's what i need to do so when are we
all wrong but i'm not happy i didn't know you could
your relationship was always in your head in the first place right right legally it's a tax modification
yeah i mean that's it that's right there's no direct line connection between the husband and the
wife except through the state it's like an amendment
to your citizenship status i think it joins the bonds and they encourage marriage because now you have
twice the bond to pull from and if one has a problem the other one's coverage then i think it's very safe
to marry like that because now they have access to both years well that's almost positive that's what it is
uh it's like double their availability because i've learned in
child protective services cases that they take one and a half million out of the fathers and one and a half million out
of the mothers now how i learned this is cases where
two people slept together had a baby but they were never together
and so you've got the the father way over here and you've got the mother over
here trying to raise this baby
and i've ran into the instances where i've been able to prove that they hold a million and a half on his
account he's never spent one day with that baby
he stinks away okay so just through the birth and dna
process make sure you as the father
well sure they'll have to prove it somehow
[Music]
anytime anyone's on any kind of government assistance they're far more likely to have a cps
problem the government pays out that's just what it is so stay off of it
uh yeah he was several states what they took
of the husband-wise social security campaign they use their social to go after their enhancement
people think oh they just go after this subsequent general fund help they go after their
is taxpayer dollars
uh
what is the correct way to go about recording your child's birth at the time of birth okay this is a big problem the one i've
been fighting for a long time can i let you out of the hospital now i know two people now they do not let them
out of the hospital and that's like physically leave and they were progressing that's right and even midwives if they
have a baby at home the midwife is required to register the baby
give your baby away to give your baby away to the state and the problem is it's under
international law that's the problem it's under interest
that in all 197 union countries it has to happen i know
an entire family in montana that neither the grandparents the parents or
their children and now their grandchildren none of them have ever had a person to man or social
security
i've talked to john about this many times and he says we will never take a seat
i run my own business and we don't associate with everyone at all they have
their children and their grandchildren at home
yeah it's a family business
they've they've been able to avoid government for many years
the problem is that's how you have to not register your debate you literally have to have it at home
and have family members delivered okay where's the law that tells the
hospital that they have the right to keep you they actually want to call this
confidence
the law falls under the ucla
the universal code of military justice president trump signed executive order
to make child and sex trafficking in international crime that allowed us in the military through
his executive orders to go arrest these people with child sex trafficking
all the evidence
they show up in the middle of night at 2 a.m they break the doors and take these people and drive to the nearest military base
and put them on a c-136 cargo plane and ship the tunnel bay where they try to
refuse the mj and execute
department of justice picks them up they go into a jail they're going to court and first slap they're out
a short period of time they're back on the streets department of justice expressed 1700
people since this effective order in march we've arrested more than 3 000 wow
there's four of us gathering those there's thousands of them
wow they're the enemy that actually because that's just based on which
supposed first pass
but this particular task force is child sex trafficking melania trump started she grew up in an
area of the world where people are very beautiful and many of her friends and family got
caught up and it is
a lot of her fellow models get caught up in sex trafficking
russian ukrainian women many caught up in sex drive
[Music]
she's already been poisoned
how was she poisoned you never got to finish hearing what poster started but how was she very similar
so in other words we all need to keep a pack of hand wipes and every single time someone that you don't know shakes your
hand just wipe your knee out question she's actually feared right
um
yeah you know in reality we can do the childbirth thing the same
way we did the marriage in a family bible we would record the event if we were to record it
that's just as legal
and that's how it should be done i feel like you're still giving him information that will be used against you by doing
that that's how the perfect job should be done however i mean we've been doing it that
way for more recently more than a thousand years just recently
okay but for us for right now until there is a law that we will go have our children and be free
the loophole is for our kids who are having kids the loot goal is have the kids and then immediately go
turn the birth certificate back into making the u.s national you understand that they don't they're still going to get the
they're still going to get the bond and the u.s is still going to get the bond for right now but at least our kids can still be free once they're
out you just have to do that right let me put it to you this one having studied the acts of congress
between 1908 1935 and set up this whole thing and seeing the fraud that could came
about because of it it didn't come about because of it
i want to tell you the other side of the court had i been one of my grandfathers during
that period of time and they would have came to us and explained with bologna's disclosure
the public charitable trust and how it works and how we're supposed to be the co trustee and co-beneficiary and the
only signatory officer and they would have explained assisted qb and how that works and
and said that here's what we're going to set up all these cqbs underneath the public charitable trust
and with full and honest disclosure in the terms and conditions that they would have said we're going to put up the upfront money
we're going to volume we're going to assure you we figured out that this is the only way to continuously fund
government but instead of being greedy bastards and taking all the money and
bloating government making it bigger and bigger and bigger we're going to treat it like it's
supposed to and actually make you the co-beneficiary and by the time you reach the age of 18
you'll start getting a check for a thousand dollars a month and by the time you're 25 it might go up to two and by the time
you're 30 it might go up to three and so on and so forth and they cut us in on the profits of the deal
like they were supposed to we put a bar inside the bargain our labor and our
credit as opposed to the government a credit of the united states government and they put up the initial
consideration the bookkeeping and keep track of it all and get invested in the american autonomy us
treasury bonds it would have been a good deal for all of us
it really would it would have limited poverty and homelessness in this country
and welfare never never would have even had to come about
well this democratic new democratic dude running for presidency i don't know which one it is but he's promised all
these kids a thousand dollars a month right so my daughter you know writes me and she's like oh i got a funny one for
you and i'm like yeah how long is that going to last i was like maybe he knows about that and that's what he's going to do
i don't know which one it is i'm like well maybe that's what he's going to do because otherwise there is not i didn't
there was the money now i know there is money here's the reason why i died yeah
because he is a united nations deal
a united states every united nations country australia canada
187 are the same slavery systems
well this is how they figured out how to get rich and to grow bigger and bigger and bigger
and more powerful more powerful but had they gave us full enough
it would have been a good deal had they done what they should have done see when
they set up the public charitable trust i was set up hundreds of years
but we the people would share the benefits of this nation that's how it was set up
opening out of the cqb they decided not to tell anybody about
it
1666 england start so then had other countries adopted it over a long
time 1707. why did you become countries jumped in so that's how you keep americans viewed
that that's all we always do if you look at english law almost every law we have in america they
had in england before us get ready for your tv license
oh yeah oh you'll go to jail if you watch tv with elizabeth
where is it that when we adopted a country
three we adopted one in effect in 1935. it was all part of the new deal like
jr1m2 yeah but if it's a united nations thing
weren't we already part of the united nations and we had to already so well no we've got to work we became part
of the united nations december 9 1945. before the united nations it was the
league of nations okay so history's uh so we took on that part
of the field you know you really gotta study to
figure out the pieces of the puzzle i mean it's hard
how do the people hold corrupt politicians accountable for the creditor committee against
[Music] here's his list of crimes
all state statutes will tell you in their state statutes that the only remedy
to a person in the state is to file directly
the only remedy okay a question on that i've been told if you file straight
to federal and you haven't exhausted your state they'll throw it out that all changed a few weeks ago president trump
signed an executive order saying you no longer need to exhaust your revenue
to go to federal courts that he signed yeah the white house yes well just
google okay another question so chris hallett says if you have a problem with one of your people file a
petition level monstrous is that different than filing a claim yes
is asking the legislature to do something about it i love chris
and he's doing things the right way i will never say anything bad about
chris or kirk or anyone else who stands up all right
but the issue is what they're doing takes a long time and you have to be
good enough to convince someone else a legislator it is the right way it's the way our
founding fathers set up for us to do and for us to go about it
but they haven't been very successful except in some counties okay
john gentry man he's running for state senator tennessee now as an
e-class member simply because he has beaten this to death in front of his
legislature he spoke in front of his legislature many many many many many times and he's
he went to the supreme court of the united states with it cost him 25 000 out of his own pocket
to get his case into the supreme court and they wouldn't even hear it it wasn't
here he had stacks of papers piled on the tables this high
people have a special copy machine that cost 15 000 to make enough copies they have to be
written a certain way they have to be put together a certain way they have to be found you have to have 91
copies sent to the supreme court and have it delivered by a trump special
delivery to get it
does not judge reviews and says no it's not worth hearing so what did he
do just the filing fees were thousands of dollars
to file settlement so what did you do then
so anyway what is he doing he keeps going to the state legislature he keeps going to the state legislature and now
he's tired of it so he's running for senator the state of tennessee i recommend
voting for him for telling everybody in tennessee that you know to vote for him because he would change the country yeah
because okay
so we don't have to learn the remonstrance process now we can go straight to following the
grievances and sorry we filed the claim i'm telling you
we should all be filing the three monstrous every one of these millions of us
the more the merrier but we don't have to wait to go to budget all weekend
i think one of the mistakes we're making on filing the three monstrous is we should be getting
200 000 signatures on each one i think that's a big mistake and i've
told those guys that you should get as many people behind you as possible
go pass them wedding do they have to be ready sure probably voters in the district too
you see what i mean if you're doing one in tennessee it's got to be people from tennessee
they should be going around and getting the signatures and here's what we're trying to do but they i guarantee if john gentry watches
the tennessee legislature that he had 200 000 signatures behind his remonstrance
he would have been successful the first
but he had john gentry's signature
i love them they're doing everything right but they need to do more
so yeah the claim you have to start with the claim especially if you're in a state court in
almost every state statute in this country says the only way to gain remedy is to file a
torque claim against them they're telling you accounting for it
yeah any anything within your state is
the immunity from the judge however there's already immunity the judges
already don't have immunity i know there's one read title 18 1983
how did the people help those that were set up by fbi and other agents officers and have been
locked up like shannon cogs i've offered to help shafer cox many many times over
the last four or five years and he listens to his friend who's an
attorney in alaska
yeah shaver doesn't belong there for
sure
[Music]
yes yes an attorney can only represent an entity a corporation online somebody
incompeter or somebody infirm where does it say they can represent a
man whose conflict
so then why do they even do competency tests if you have an attorney they can just throw you right into a psych word you already know what you think you did
you are exactly yeah yeah see what i mean correct your status
first you're verse right do you need a license to practice
if you are or want to be a doctor man
do you i don't so go ahead what's the answer
change your status that's right you don't need a license an attorney doesn't have a license to
practice do you understand that right no state issues a license to an
but if you get your insurance yeah like i mean technically you need more hours and more training between
the cosmetologists than you do wait i would just have this obviously
you know what they want for police officers right six months
i know several officers could have made mistakes intentionally on their exams so they can
so when i when i successfully park my status i will no longer
[Music] there's some doctors here now i know
they're shutting them down because they were used to vaccinating kids and so they're going to have their licensing
absolutely absolutely you got to understand what is legal is
unlawful legal is an abomination to god it says [Music]
okay we have been so sold and so indoctrinated
to this country for all these reasons what about a contractor who builds
houses and has to get licenses and permits to build on someone's private property
see the problem is it's not private property it's so residential which is a commercial term
next summer i'll be able to build all my running sheds that i want to help my pastors without paying oh yeah i built a whole
bunch of them and uh my neighbors all got together and said he didn't get permissed for those i said the rust measure 120 square feet
i don't need purpose for those see i knew a lot better than they did but they all fished and complain i had
chairs showing up my property i had the county kennedy show up
so hey you guys operated under time you know it's 18 section 242
under the kelvin law truck up on down the road you know we're wasting my time because i'm charging you uh
2500 an hour my license i have to redo my license every two three years and three years ago when
i did it was 300 because last time
[Music]
all your customers become members of your practice of ema now here the medical industry is
screwed okay mainly because of insurance and other things now a practice like
this where insurance doesn't cover in any way people pay cash
and i would not call his practice in chiropractic
i would call it a holistic wellness center or something like that a private
membership association now the zombie is not going to have some
fights here you will never come
you're supposed to be doing it this way you're doing it this way prove to me that that's right and you
can say prove to me that's wrong on them prove to me it is wrong
private membership associations have been around their airport and they're what they say they are
they're private but you have to give phone honest disclosure to your clients
your customers patients they have to become
members of the pma so when they come in and they fill out their form it's a pma form
and it says you're authorizing to be a private member so as you pour
that you get these benefits you know the benefit could be something
that he gives away you do this procedure and you adjust
that if you come up with your own rules
and then they agree to it and they're members
when people shop at costco it's kind of special you have your own costco card
you can make little wall
do she need malpractice insurance i i would say you need some
an umbrella policy liability policy can cover anything that that's a
liability so yeah i would have something
um
38 years i had contractors
right
so do you still if you believe in homeowners insurance and if you can't afford to replace your home
like liability insurance and you mentioned finally yes we were supposed to protect us protects
us our families and our neighbors yeah i just didn't know i want to make sure that it wasn't because i thought about that
so i'm a verbally very figuring out a way to do this okay i'll i'll tell you all something as
far as health insurance the christian health insurance companies
are the way to go my jesus husband my niece's husband died
about a year and a half ago from pancreatic cancer and he went through three years of hell
and their normal premium from where he worked went up to like 900
some dollars a month they couldn't afford it and their insurance company
dropped him 90 days after he no longer worked there because he was on chemo
therapy he was in the hospital and he wasn't working and they dropped him
i didn't even think they could do that but they did and so they went through one of the
christian networks
and the christian network paid out over half a million dollars
and what it is it's just a whole bunch of christian people going to churches who all put in together and they draw
out of it and support each other
how do you protect your kids from forced vaccinations
no i'm serious i know how i'd protect them
[Music] try it hey you need a postcard back to water
yeah
that's why i'm trying to learn that
study report and help all of us get together in groups on facebook and start talking about the
environmental core guy that introduced this to me is an
expert environment and he lives in arkansas
it's one of the main reasons i wanted to go down to arkansas so we've got daniel to get me down here
he's not the guy
he's a man he's i think he's in his 70s he worked for the offshore oil rigs for
exxon in alaska and they only work half a year they get paid a lot of money while
they're working on those oil freezes offshore but they won't work out here he slid in
alaska the state of alaska came in and said
they passed some legislation that said they had to have restaurants in all their state parks
so they put restrooms in and now they have a problem how do we
keep them clean how do we clean out those toilets how do we do that he said no problem
start bumper company he bought pump trucks one around all the state parks
half a season then hired somebody who was on going for the other half they got to be so profitable and exxon
found out that he had another business and said wait a minute you got to be loyal to us you can't have another
business on site you said why doing just running just fine and i'm still doing my job
and they said no you either sell it or you quit
see you later not like spending time out the ocean in the cold wind and rain and storms
anyway so he expanded his bumper business instead
then he was a very smart man and he started to design patent certain
aspects well pieces of equipment things like that he
got really well done big company out of california said hey i'll just sell your company come down
here and we'll put you on some big projects and he went on these big projects and he
was making some real big bucks and doing these big projects
and one of these big companies like dow chemical
tremendous
yeah but anyway
so anyway he said you know every building's got a toilet
this courthouse has a toilet i can shut these courthouses down i can do all kinds of things through the
environment if they've got toilets they're out of compliance if they're running water
all you have to do is go online and look up every chemical that's in that city water system he says david what water company do you
have at your house i said the av avion water company out of bed he looks up avion three or four toxins
in my water at my house
[Music]
my goal is to health let's use that chord i said what does
this do for vaccines so we can shut all that down
starting to proceed to tell me that vaccines biological warfare i started
researching looking up sure enough he's right his biological warfare wow
i think there's so
oh so we can find those cases
and this is what they said yeah the environmental court this is
it
how do you protect your kids if one parent wants to vaccinate the other
distance
you know one of the biggest problems is arguments between husbands and wives i lost that battle because at the time i
mean 20 years ago but i was the only one in the world that thought that way so it was me against
the world and if i was wrong then i'd be fully liable in everybody's minds and if they're wrong then oh that's just the
way everybody does it i can't spot as a foreign agent is if you want to keep a wife and say yes
honey yeah okay doesn't matter what she says
that's that's the only way it works
how do you deal with old ticket interactions red light tickets and stuff like that just to fade them
sending an abatement it's a vaping process you say hey
i had all these from a long time ago i just want all this done and over with
how old do we talk if it's over seven years you can say this past the statute of limitations
yeah if if they're less than seven years say they're four years old
you can say you know i haven't paid these because i never really believed i had to i was operating
private traveling right now you guys are operating under title 18 section 2.2
and so why don't we just make these tell me there's a pavement process
this is called the faith
based on the way you think the way you feel i'm right there
[Music]
i don't
move your ass along you're my circle i'm the boss telling them what to do i
will you please vote yes or no on this item demand and he says well yeah if i got that
choice so you just have to notice an appearance god notice an appearance
just said an appointment you can do it all in
i here a really good friend who's an expert at it you read it it sounds like he wrote it right on the bible and beats it all
all right he he's been thrown in jail a dozen times he
he's he's driven
yeah because he says he says thank you judge for holding me in contempt
it's my opportunity to go preach the gospel to my fellow men and he starts walking out i'm gonna go
teach all the people and he does he starts teaching him and there's been a lot of times the judge
says i'd hold you in contempt except you'll go train all the people in the jail
well what is it um they put you
a lot of times when i fly out of town i park my truck at his house and he takes me to breakfast and then we go
to here
and he drives your truck through a bunch of red lights and just stuff so you can go to courts and go to the chickens that way it cost me a breakfast when i
leave at a dinner when i get back but i don't have to pay 15 a day to park my truck here it's good
okay she's a pretty impressive collection of the red light things
but don't they take your driver's
[Music] license
um because they they sent it to my old address and then after like nine months they sent it to my real address
and then by that point
[Music]
like five miles and then down to to hit that toll road so there's no chance in how that i've
ever taken it in that park ever i've never done it i've never i'd go out of my way to until i told someone
i take back them they told me i needed to go down to this one place that was 15 20 miles away from where i
lived and during these set times that it was like a five hour period and they wouldn't they would you know
all these tall boots are illegal right every single one of them is
so you go to the courthouse and you say i'd like to discuss abatement and they'll put you into the front of
the right people you're doing that document document and you send it to the reporter everything is
done by email by paper
and that's the hard thing is for me to get started
really
because i have to fix that before i decided
so the 72 hours you have the method that i used on my registration ticket where you can do uh
now here here's one of dave burger's statutory debates
i can't believe i have them do we need to make copies so you still have it whether you're on touches oh yeah
you've probably been down a few moments of the usfl videos right
yeah okay that's right i don't listen to moores okay for a reason okay he's a good guy
he seems to be very knowledgeable he works very hard
there's an issue with force in their religion okay and that's it they all want
something for nothing the only reason they learn this stuff or doing it
is to get something for them okay to get their money back they'll go out
and buy a car and then they'll get a loan on it and then they will eat for me
or whatever they will do some kind of a process not to ever have to pay for anything
yeah all the time they don't pay for anything i believe in paying our way
to be honest with our fellow men i don't believe in fraud if there's fraud and corruption involved
i fight it but regardless you don't do it intentionally
right with the attitude that i'm going to go get something free i i understand now procedurally though
he's probably accurate relative he's about
80 okay nobody's 100 i i want because i got the
method for the um you know i refused the software contract from his his words and
you used different words yesterday that uh really included what was was going on in
214 with pre-travel and everything else and the the appropriate colors and
everything so this this this silliness of 45 degree writing and colors and
everything else you're doing i i guess that's just to draw attention that it's being written by a man that knows yeah that actually goes back
quarterback to the kingston where could we reference this and there's not a chicago styles for this
type of writing so where could we reference this to find out exactly what is right about offsetting a ticket like this
what is the correct way to refuse the software contract it's called the bankers it is
but the issue with the ticket like that is
there's probably i got six i know i have 60 pages
of case law probably 10 case laws let's just say there's 10
case less on each page 60 pages it says we have the right to travel and they
cannot impede us anywhere adam speaks book has any great
speaks wonderful okay so the process of the ticket
is just to show that the officer made a mistake see an officer's
first question when he walks in the window should be hi sir how you doing
are you operating in commerce or operating
the second and question second question should be what have you self-determined
your steps to be yeah because there's different procedures for different steps
i got a good friend who's an arm stealer for many governments he's he
helps military get their honors okay and he has to ask if there are state
national or states or citizens or what their status is he has to yes that's just in your state
or we should get a license plate that just says we're a national so he came to one of my classes i don't know eight nine years ago
came to one of my classes and i'm up here talking about status and stuff and he's one of the only guys i've met
in a long time in my classes who knew everything there was to know about steps is because
he has to deal with it every day on every form
star system
i also believe when you walk into court they should ask you what jurisdiction you're operating under
you can get information from everything but what i'm going to tell you is
and you gather from everybody the more you're going to do find something that you might believe in
that's actually wrong sure what you want to do is you want to keep things as simple as possible
that's the key to the whole thing for 20 years i made this business complicated and i started to make it
simple that it was teachable and people weren't getting in the trunk
and i don't want people in trouble so if you can do simple little things if
we figure out simple little things those little napkin presentations in various ways to even defend yourself from the judge
where you can nail them down to a specific what is the law you have
to do that because you have to establish the jurisdictions of three jurisdictions you've got to establish
that because you have to nail them down and make them commit that they're in contract law you have to
so then you show jurisdiction because that's the bar
associate's been misusing that term for years i didn't know that for a while a long
time when i finally figured out that they've been misusing that i found out it'd been misusing it on
purpose that may be bad so now that's one of
your priorities to establish juris which is the right law you nail it down
to its contract law now you can rebut presumptuous assumptions and hearsay
tacit agreement and you can say look here's the aid illness of the contract bring forth the contract
if it doesn't meet these eight facts not here saying presumptions but facts
then we're done here and you win cases over and over and over again based upon
facts a timeline of what happened what is the actual facts what took
place because they'll just until live in july of july and they'll hang you by it you did the twelve presumptions of
eight facts on the first date right
[Music] thank you thank you very much
those are keys that is you know
yeah what kind of gets
is there a good resource for that
i'm are you making money at it that's it technically
super interstate commerce states can only regulate interest in
cars
because someone on the interstate if i want to drive from flooring to me on an interstate
there should never be a fee as i'm traveling through and i'm
traveling
you mentioned that toys also so state tollways are illegal
all tolls are technically illegal because what does the constitution say trample says they have the right to
pursue happiness and move towards peaceful assembly so at any time i'm moving towards peaceful assembly i cannot be intercepted
it's your right and locomotion so what do you guys do do you not pay tolls what or what are you going
to do what do you do david what do you do you go through tolerance and you just blow them off and they send
you stuff and you send it back the only thing that can hold you hold up is your license so if you're traveling freely and you
don't care about elections it doesn't make any difference well but if you need a license for certain times
you might need a license no police officer is going to see my
license ever true unless i'm in the semi hauling a little hay that's the only time i need a license if
i didn't when i cut down to 10 horses i won't need to semi anymore i'm going to sell
that sucker my license is going out the window okay so you only have a listing on cars you
do driving that's right i have to come out so that you
with just that they will never see my driver's license so who cares if they suspend it but you
go through toll booths without paying you don't have a total ipass or whatever a toll pass thing you don't pay on it
anyways yeah this will be pretty good do an update that's a question house of state of new
york because of eight days of not paying tolls they sent me a cute little letter okay
send you a hus 175 and 83 cents and i wrote across it with a red sharpie
your offered a contract is not accepted while i'm traveling in private you cannot impede my right of locomotion
is that what i do with the red line you operate under title 18 section 242 under the color of law
you think you should take it on the spot you can cause them a whole lot of time no problem what did you send it back
i bailed it off my friend aubrey gave his state id that
he carries instead of a driver's license and they put his state id number in the driver's license number
and he came down on them for fraud uh form and i mean just held them away from sunday
and uh again okay this is a little list i came up with okay
it's law right law equals jurisdiction equals words land air water land

that's right i'm sure dave's paperwork says in there

certainly can you email that statement
h
is you guys can share thanks
all right
third-party collection proof of claims
okay question so i have a ten dollar bill from a doctor that i reduced it i didn't
pay it out of principle is this cancerous stuff on my neck that i two years ago a doctor told me it was
stupid go away don't do anything so i just didn't pay your ten dollar copay
but they never asked for when i went in anyways but then they sent me a bill for it and i just threw it
i'm the procrastinator that won't do stuff on time
so i want i don't want it it's gonna put it's gonna bring my credit report down mr bill collector
even if it was a few months ago though it's not within 72 hours mr bill clinton did you
pay off the ten dollars to the doctor
yes or no if you did thank you very much for that gift i
appreciate it i needed it at this time but you and i have no privity of
contract okay but can they still so if we do that
can that still be about cancer credit rating sitting out there then you can rebut it
at the credit here
okay student loans are a whole different
animal because they're government-backed if you had a private student loan which
there ain't very many of them out there it does count but almost all students
are government back
i need to figure it out
do i have to refute my citizenship before i rescind my voter's registration
any voter could rescind their voter's registration at any time just because your assistant doesn't mean
you have to talk but you have to do it before you can be an electoral
this question says can i get bond insurance on a vehicle that is not in my debt you don't get bond on
a vehicle your bond you're driving
you're liable your money your bond will pay you
when you say bond that's just insurance differentiation right that's what they thought there's bonding companies there's
insurance companies there's insurance companies that sell bonds is the bonding company less expensive
oh really i mean i got usa if you wouldn't got a 100 300 100 policies
with state park on a car it's probably around 90 bucks a month if you've got a
decent yard 90 bucks a month how much is that it's
almost 1100
to go get a one million dollar abroad liability bond three to six hundred dollars
yes so that's just while you're doing anything on your uh while you're in the vehicle for
anything right for a recovery it's an umbrella policy liability anytime you cause harm to someone else
you are liable and if they come after you i don't care if it's for a dog bite
somebody falling off one of your horses uh yeah but what i'm saying is
you probably pay a lot on your homeowner's insurance so remove that and just get my own
umbrella policy on myself oh yeah okay see what i mean and it would come back you don't want people to
don't you rich people get absolute minimum insurance on everything that they possibly can
and then they get a big umbrella liability but we won't need insurance once we
remove our title or our plates and registration from the vehicle insurance won't be necessary
but you still want to protect yourself but no but you still want to get your uh your bond to protect whoever you hit
well exactly but the bond will do that yeah yeah i can get rid of my life my
muscles in my industry they require call it a two plus two
if i have my homeowners insurance will they no they don't require my
trainer's insurance so you're right that's only for myself i don't have to have that
what companies like where do you how do you find the bonding company i use century insurance and ben it's
just a great big insurance company that represents hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of companies
they're not uh like they're a broker and they find the best bond price every
year i use melts there you go not not
i do i do because i am
credit you can get five million dollars you can get whatever you think is necessary i mean
if you live in a 10 million dollar home and you drive a hummer or something you know
have a 150 000 living quarters horse trailer like i have
like i had i i had to celebrate
but yeah think of it this way though my friend dave crashed the truck the other day and his doctor bills were exceeding 800
000 to this date so it's one truck wreck i mean you can hit that million dollars without
to somebody else automobile policies only a million if he got truck
but that's why that's health insurance he chooses to have if he wants to or he's not sure you're
right it's really number one
is so it's per event or event or prior
no per year here you get it if you have five events you better not go to the room but after
end of the year
me cardboard right that's what getting rid of credit card debt you have
to let it go into collections how does that affect your credit
once it goes to correct collections it's easy to prove there's no primitive contract
and then you can go to the credit bureau and have it regulated does it affect your credit yeah for a
short period of time through that process maybe 60
you have to prove the fraud you basically got to take them to court and say they did a fraudulent thing
and let me tell you something some attorney wrote that credit card application that you didn't read you
just signed it because you wanted to run it and they wrote it in such a way to put all the liability on you and none on
them so you probably lose that loss and again that's where that goes into where maybe the boards
would do that but that's principle that's doing the right thing but you bought the stuff pay for it right and i believe that too
i believe in pain if they're not involved in broader corruption
questions after collections well we're incurring
someone else's debt that would have different stories right i mean well there are companies who
purchase the items that i think as far as who are actually according to my
principal yeah
um
out how to actually make it work however i know some people it works for
sometimes when it begins to work all the time for someone i'll listen to what they have to
say but i've studied that i did the ucc one 12 13 15 years ago
i went through the whole secure part of creditor craft and i can't think of one instance where
it could be any good and csu then
great you know the bays and the elves
they used that to try and fly to the corvette i don't know
my dad
oh my gosh
there's lots of things i like about it but writing an 85 million dollars check to the government because 25 000
penalties and all this other stuff and seeing how he does his business and how the government does it
he literally told me to to my face that um i think he's turning into an anarchist
he doesn't want to get attacked and i want to find ways to limit his liability you know
i gotta tell you something i'm a firm believer that not everyone can
because if you don't you're not following god's law but there are some people that can't
handle they can't end so do i believe in self-government yes
do i believe in government yes now the issue is that's the whole
purpose of our heavenly father's limited government the main purpose
of the united states the reason it was created was to protect us from invading parties that's it
as
to secure our rights we the people asked our states
to sign a degree creating the federal government to provide us with 19 essential
governmental services and no more 18 of them are clearly listed in the first
pages of the constitution the 19th is listed in the pre-end of the constitution
so there's 19 services we agreed to pay for and no more the end no more
i can't say this enough the end no more is the most important part of the whole degree
yeah we said we need this is this this and this but we don't need anything else from
then on we're self-governed or we're governed by our state and our localities
where we can direct our government see that's why i drew the the
bottom up form of government instead of the top down because government is supposed to be
about your townships and your parishes
decentralized to local environments that's right because and the reason why is so the people
can afford to affect government to effectively manage government
and that's why i explained yesterday i know it cost me ten dollars to go over here to my little
city council and spend some time in a fact government
if i go to the county it might cost me 20 bucks if i go to the state it might cost me 100 or 200 if i go to the
federal it could cost me thousands because i've got to take 25 30 people or more before them in a
year so all those people need airline tickets and hotels
transportation and that's the whole purpose of why our government
was founded obama i talked to the moors of
a bit and one of the things that they're talking about with this you know buying a bed and writing it off and all the
stuff that they said it was gold and silver we would absolutely play by the rules but since
this is monopoly money with nothing but debt-based nonsense we're going to take advantage that's right all the way to the beginning and that's how they just
yeah and i agree with you have real money yes there's no real money though i mean
what they're saying is with the fractional reserve or fractional lending you're not taking anything from anyone
because it's just a big balloon that's gonna grow no matter what of course okay here here's where here's where
they're full of crap okay car company produces
x number of cars right the workers on that assembly line have to get paid
they have to make enough money off those cars to pay those folks the guy that built the building and
built the assembly line has to get paid the guys that made all the machines on it have to get paid all these people get
paid when they don't pay for a car they're stealing from all they're paying
for the car through their bond otherwise they would have been double paying for that car
right
prior to the 1999 bankruptcy guys like me could get a black card
that's why they keep us perpetually in depth we're under chapter 13 bankruptcy
organization all the time
thanks to that david
edward's plan and nelson aldridge
aldridge the aldridge plan was the monster coming out of the bible
it's predicted the bible is one of the events that has happened in history you can prove the bible over and over
and over again is that the monster that's right you're bringing it up you can prove the bible
over and over again monster rises up out of the sea it was the octopus rising up on a gentle
is
i developed this whole powerpoint presentation just to teach people the history of how we got to where we are
it's the actual documented history of
something there's the alderage plan
it's written drawn up on jekyll island come on leviathan
[Music]
if i thought oh i could get this in a group in about three hours five hours later we're still
halfway into it so i broke it into a couple different parts but the second the first part's all
history you'll like this one yeah they had a sense of humor
we're gonna sit around tv and watch this party at my house that support
here's our three flags
in the field when you were coming into shore maybe 120 years ago verticals change over time
if you look at the coast guard flag that's our maritime war flag that we use right now coast guard flying is this
exact flag with the coast guard local right the middle of it
[Music]
here's where the government confiscated all of our gold and silver this is a picture of an actual poster
okay hold on back to the flag stephen i what will happen like what kind of trouble am i asking
for to fly that vertical strike flag nothing
120 years ago you'd be able to identify buildings right off the bat like okay this is a government building this is a
private building this is a private house it's a private business this is you know government business you can see by the flags and it was fine because
everybody knew the difference nobody knows
okay so i want a presentation from you about all the flags she was just bringing up the um what was
it india i don't know anything about it
an icelandic police officer who explains why his country's bullies are so nice and rarely have to use
violence he says we jailed or kicked out all the corrupt politicians and bankers
so we don't have to force laws made by tyrants yeah the exact opposite of what america does
yes that was a great statement an islamic police officer you've said
that islamic
so anyway it explains why his country's police are so nice and rarely have to use violence that's
exactly the same statement chinese
their government does not bother the chinese people but they're gonna be just right
they're government's communists our government
okay you
there's so much misconceptions about china i had many many misconceptions about
china because i listened to local government
plywood cutouts for a police car telling you to drive safe and protect your neighbor
says that right okay you go to the big train stations
and i'm talking half a million people they've gone through these train stations
the police officers in the train stations driver they're pretty they're like a fancy golf
cart they couldn't catch anybody if they wanted the outfit
and none of them wear guns nothing they wear blue shirts and tan pants with a stripe
down the shirt and was identified as a police officer there on their back
no no tasers no guns no flashlights
and they're nice they ask you if you need corrections are you a tourist you need directions
let me take your picture no yeah you walk through town downtown angie or shanghai
across the street giving tourists directions build guns no tasers no them
it's the only place that i saw in several trips to china
i go to lunch with groups of engineers two hour lunches pull up into a parking spot at this
restaurant and sidewalk
people 14 or 15 wide the sidewalks come here and there was people walking back and
forth i don't know how many houses people walking back and forth the engineers pulled their car
up the bumper's right here like the edge of the sidewalk
first time they did that i got out of the car they're all walking in towards russia and go hey
you're gonna roll up the windows you got your computer sitting on their seats and says why don't china be reaching
that car no china but stealing that i said why not
i said because 25 children are walking down the sidewalk and tackle beat them to death
hold them for the police because they're allowed to citizenship
here you'll get sued by the guy that yeah
that's where a chinese citizen went to tune square to protest
now if you're coming after the government now they're going to have some interactions but if you're just out there living in
your life they will give you the heck alone
i wonder plus they all drive black audiences
depending on their level of government you're driving four and a six and a seven years and
then and this is bottom a mile away because no nonsense will buy blackout concerns
but the government won't drive this blockade it's not good yeah driving chinese
but here's another thing you go to china you see chevy supports catalogs
pontiacs and buicks and you see every other car made in the world peugeots and
spectrums french cars you see every brand of automobile bmw's porsches
you see everything what about japanese stuff we wouldn't even know existed oh yeah toyotas
nissans everything's in general they import every vehicle there's russian cars in
china there's korean cars in china i'm telling
you they they're people are free to buy what they want when was the last time you saw the site
true dealership here out of this country personally 40 years
to stop those dealerships they can't import any side roads
the dealerships can't exist so that all the sudden the dealership's going away
so our government limits us and he congratulates us
so anyway this whole entire presentation how do you like this
do you okay so you went to where all the records were and you read
all of the you know you came to illinois and read all abraham lincoln's buddies letters they said you came to illinois
to relate or you didn't you didn't know archives oh i thought okay so
you read them do you have copies of any of that or you did you write down or
is it all just in your head are you able to take pick photos of stuff in the national archives
yes they will allow you to do that so is this the question i should be
asking you should i this was before we had celtics so you don't have record of what you
read yeah it's all in the national archives i got probably 350 000 documents on this
computer i mean go to my iphone there's hundreds
of books
yeah but they're going to keep what they want like what he read 35 years ago i've been able to go there they're going
to be different than what they have now they are right people who find old letters and
journals in states estate sales and people's attics
all over this country they sell them to collectors collect yourself to the they sell this
smithsonian they sell them to the national archives and those letters they're all there
you can go through and find letters and journals of people who live during any time in our country's history
there's letters from abe lincoln there's letters from everyone i was just wondering if they're
that unlawful of the government that they hide the stuff
that they don't
is the egyptians of america yeah and there's all kinds of
egyptian sultans right here in america
there's an entire pyramids underwater they're beautiful
the tops of those pyramids are only about 25 feet under the surface the tops
the bottoms are 200 feet under the surface
look how many of us are seeking it they don't care hey there are three pyramids in ohio
that somehow we're completely buried with dirt but because of our satellites from oxfam
they discovered those three pairs and if you look at where the top of the pyramids are
they measure the same distance of the triangles
so what are they saying but aren't those alien things too where they're saying that they're egyptians no it's either
here let me keep talking about that let me keep talking burroughs cave in missouri
he's a farmer there was a flood he had a little bit of landslide on his
property he looks kind of last slide underneath there's this little rock
ledge and he saw that it was hull so he crawled down in
thousands and thousands and thousands of feet of caves filled with egyptian
artifacts and car esophaguses and one of the most important
things is a big round black slate rock
i'll tell you about this rock this rocks map and it had the rocky mountains so we had
a grand canyon drawn in to have an egyptian supplement that's on the north end of the grand canyon yeah
do you know the pop idiots dna is egyptian it's the only indian tribe in
america this egyptian dna it showed the show of florida
the gulf of mexico of mexico it showed the entrance of the
mississippi showed up in the tennessee river valley where there's been egyptian mines discovered
in mining equipment egyptian this is all pre-initial flood stuff
right now this is time of christ so
the ohio river valleys all mapped out mississippi is mapped out clear up past minneapolis
is mapped out a river of leads right to palmyra new york you know
what's famous about palmer new york joseph smith discovered golden place
in the elk
translated it became the book of mormon which is a history book of the people who lived in the americas
at the time of christ that's all it is history just like the bibles of history
and some people who lived during the time what was translated correctly who knows
the bible wasn't even there's little things missing okay however
it was still a history of people who lived in the same type of handwriting that the
bible was written in the videos so you start to put this
stuff together let me tell you something one of the first things i learned
in the intelligence is there's a cave on the north side the grand canyon that was taken a mormon pioneer was
taken there by a hop in it was full of egyptian artifacts full of
esophagus and they think two of them it's cleopatra
you know quite bad through mark anthony when they committed suicide their bodies and
tumors have never been found they think they're right there on the north end of the grand canyon the
irrigation system was built on the north side of the grand canyon any any archaeologist will tell you
since 1920 the secret service has been guarding them
the smithsonian took most of the artifacts they put in storage warehouse
just talked about the building that it is in and they're going to build it in ford is going to have all of the egyptian
stuff are they going to admit it came from the united states
if that's our land then why can't we go there we how can they guard our land
from us to the people it was a secret their regard because it didn't fit america it didn't
make christians
yeah is washington was supposedly the first i'm not i'm not a history i haven't been
in 1776 we arrived in this country 1607
and 1620 in massachusetts 1607 in virginia okay you don't think we had any kind of
government between 1607 and 1776 that's all in 170 years
um what's that reservation called the springs colorado south of that and west of that what's that whole thing
called that whole reservation the
yeah what's that called they're not my cereal we have you we have
new yeah is the largest existing civilization on them but but the four corners area is just
filled with um there's montezuma's castle in arizona and there's
down the street is called old house circa 1250. columbus sailed to ocean blue 1492 found
churches and houses and churches
and houses and this question somebody's going to have to kind of add to it a little bit taxes go to hr with
more does that include assets tell me what you meant let me ask that
question who asked
if you if you volunteer to do that you can have taxes taken care of all of our taxes are voluntary i don't
well i know that's because
you filled up the improper part
now what if uh my computer company does not accept them
if they were telling me that if we have a person that is tax exempt that they cannot handle that
they can't handle
they should be able to handle where they're incompetent
all kinds of steps there's all kinds of things we can eat we can go to them with the god trust
say hey i don't i don't i don't own anything i don't earn any wages
everything i earn goes to god
here's the god trust here's how you paint hand of the god trust get him to
write the paychecks of god trust not you not your name not your social security number not
enough to put it in the trust here's the thing it's another heart because that was
legal and this one's lawful
credit unions and non-fdic's credit unions let me show you something
i have a trust an irrevocable trust facing through a credit union
i'm trying to figure the difference between preventative trust as opposed to when you're looking for this
this is a voice of youth credit card through a credit union and it's a god trust okay yeah
so there's certain credit meetings that you recommend brothers
i start the organization start 30 years before
[Music]
switch
accounts went through their legal department they close to our accounts and they handle this about the month
without any man yes
they have to run things by their attorneys see that's why i tell that story i think
that's an important story to tell the kid in the space
seattle's a unique town literally the largest corporations in the world were based in seattle
and to have an attorney firm have the gall to say we run
he took away all those little private business owners and ceos of various corporations
including bill gates and bones and amazons and he took away all their
power without one state he says they don't do anything until they run by an illegal
our greatest enemy in the world today is the bar by far by far
is the bar association our association is in harmony that has usurped all four branches of
our country here there are congress they're represented there are judicial very amount of illustrated
perhaps don't think for a minute anything president trump does
isn't run by some darn attorney named william barr
i thought the queen just got on board queen got on
[Music]
because we screwed up yeah we the people are more numerous
and more powerful than any of them idioms they control the first experience
they control the attorneys which control the corporations
yes somewhere in there so you say the queen still has plenty of losses above her
guitar and she's in the same boat we are point of england queen of holland and it
used to be the vatican it's not tbn
now in reality it should be in this community who is
he's the grandson of marcos of the philippines who was pulled out of
power by the united states government and duarte was put in place
king george wanting to target
if you turn every gold bar under westminster or every gold bar under the airport in
missouri switzerland over there's a stamp and a number
everybody
they would have to unload two-thirds of every shipping container just to look at
it otherwise
um what's up with that story of hold on a second
mike uh st germain and the world bank is that just a total
story going around because that to me seems sort of like these guys because they also want to end um but it
says it was it sounds like a fallacy a total meet up story the bank of saint-germain
so who is he because he's supposedly i it's been a couple months since i read it so who is he and all this money was
supposedly taken out from under the buildings and it was the same regards the banks
they were trying to move all the money into three locations after 9 11. so they
really did there was money under that building and there's really five locations two of
them are pretty secret right now we know where they are it was pretty secret so there really was gold
under those buildings and they did move it there were millions of times
why where because where else do they put it they haven't ever fallen to zurich
on the tarmac steel rainforest
so that story that i have is okay so yeah that saint germain he's a saint he's not a real he's not a
i have to read the story again but all that stuff that i read in that was probably a lot of it was true
80 plus years old ladies and
that trust holds
king solomon's fortunes from all king solomon's minds all over the world from the philippines from the mayor's
from the easter islands from the cookbottles from the incas in south america from the
mines he collected gold all his gold because it was his
he inherited those peoples were king solomon's miners descendants
of king solomon's miners that were left all over the world from king solomon's
so you have to understand history and how hierarchy works and how
these people got from the garden of eden down through king
david king saul and how they spread throughout the world phil el pino
his first people trace their ancestors through the muhammad tribe
right through seth right now
how do they get there because they each
okay [Music]
okay
[Music] where he proved genealogically that all the presidents are related
however there's six degrees of separation so that would be easy to prove that everyone's related anyways that's my
skepticism on that right i mean within six degrees i'm related to
loyalty sure well six degrees of separation right you just have to find it
[Music] and then they went through legal and they got shut down
yes okay this account that i showed you from ocu i went to the same county and recorded
my documents on the same credit union that he's been making with 30 years and i opened accounting my
new god trust and great stages and god
trust
he's been there 30 plus years so somewhere along one some kind of a regulation
changed or policy changed in ukraine that they wouldn't accept god trust
but there's christian credit means there's all kinds of different places we
any credit union or any bank
do these credit unions just take the certificate or do they need the entirety of the god trust to see the body
no i gave them a copy of the full body of trust yeah okay a
full body of the trust and they know your business
so this document i also gave and it's a whole bunch of laws in fact all this was taken right off the
irs's website and it says every organization exempt from federal income
tax under internal revenue code section must file an annual information return
except a church an inter-church organization of
local units of a church a convention or association of churches and integrated the auxiliary of a church
a church-affiliated organization that is exclusively engaged in managing funds or maintaining
retirement
recommendation programs school below college level affiliated with the church are operating by religious order and
church affiliated mission societies and more than half their activities are conducted in or directed in persons
in foreign countries or an exclusively religious activity of any religious
order if it's religious they can't tell you crap no
church has to be a 501c3 if they do they've caved in they've gone against
god's laws and became
recently the irs lost 175 million dollar class action lawsuit that
included more than 700 000 people in businesses to recover
unlawful license fees paid to the irs or ptins
eins and tips
okay in the bible it says that which is legal is unlawful
it says abomination there's five authors in the bible that's
clearly distinguished between a man and a person
seriously yes
22 says do not put the flowering titles upon a man
for if i do i will surely be swept away
[Music]
abomination it's a crime in violation of 42 usc section 408
a 8 is a crime in violation of 18 usc 911
it's a crime in violation of 18 sec usc 912 to use or compel the use of any
government issue to identify a number in connection with the submitter such as a social
security number defined in 20cfr422.103d
or our taxpayer identification number is defined in 26 usc 6109
banking law states is you as a bank employee if policy directs you to ask for an
identity number such as an ssi and either a din
and you are denied or refused your only requirement is to do a single page affidavit stating
you asked and you were denied and then added into the account
file it does not mean you're denying
if no information or return is filed the internal revenue service cannot assess
you so in other words if you don't turn anything into the irs
they can't assess you for taxes
that's a statement made by gary makovsky
our tax system is based upon voluntary assessment and payment not just that's the united states
supreme court in flora versus the united states
our tax system is based on individual self-assessment voluntary compliance that's border
chaplain former commissioner of the internal revenue service in the internal revenue audit manual of
1975 that's published
there was a public declaration
[Music] i like this one the united states has a system of taxation
by confession black supreme court justice in the u.s
versus rigor
a system of taxation by conviction isn't that consent we confessed yeah we earned this
much money let's put on the 1040. what is the word 1040 cover where's that number come from
this is fun i don't know what to do with that you
why didn't you say something you you had your opportunity to embarrass it
i mean you didn't take it
where'd that come from
during the civil war he asked we the people
to invest in 10 40 bonds
and we're still investing in forty ones
wow only now forced into it by our own
victory
the internal revenue service is considered to be a bureau of the department of the treasury
however like the federal reserve is not part of the federal government
you can find that diversified middle class versus the irs at all
you can also find it in cv-93-405e
dash eje usbcdi you can also find it
codified through congress in public law 94 564. you can also fund it in senate
report 94-1148 on page 5900
of that senate report you can find it in the reorganization
plan number 26 codified in public law 102-391
is in fact incorporated in the state of delaware is where the internal
revenue services incorporate it was incorporated in 1925
the municipal irs was incorporated in 1933
because we went bankrupt it's the marine corps
1933 can you please send this to christy so
that we can because i if you lost me and i don't i want to spend more time listening than writing down but so i can recognize i don't want
to spend more time listening either no i want to listen to you otherwise i'm trying to keep up with all the numbers
anything you do with an irs isn't a mission it's a confession it's through your own
consent no one has to operate through the irs if
your status isn't we the people once you change your status you're done
now you have to figure out how to be done with your employer and done with others
see i got one little advantage other than the united states navy and other federal agency and a couple of
other little jobs that i've taken i've never worked
for anybody else i've always designed implemented
start my own businesses creating my own things did i make mistakes you have a whole
heck out of this one here
over that period of time that's the same sign as busy as i hope
there's many crazy assists okay question negative
um anything negative that could come out of not that we're used to any luxuries that we receive from the
government as far as protection and all that stuff that we by not by giving up the texas
and you know us being self-governed and said anything to look for what that will happen you know what
negative impact will this have on us i am very happy to pay my share of the taxes for 19 essential governmental services
because i'm a we the people and i agreed to that for my ancestry my hierarchy and that's what we asked
our government to provide and no more but i have a real problem
with paying for 6 000 services that i'm forced to gun point to pay for
you're killing people i have no problem with my money there you go yeah one of the privileges was the
currency and the federal reserve provides that's one of them services is
no it's american currency provided by the united states
which does not exist anymore the united states treasury is now under the ima
the secretary of the treasury gets his paycheck from the world
our treasury ceased to cease to exist in 1933
but that's when they confiscated all the gold and silver they confiscated over one
million dollars valued at twenty dollars an ounce from my grandfather
he was a geologist from the state of california and they gradually took all of his gold
and silver or he would have had ten thousand dollar fine with five years
forced
and caught that car but it was starting in 1961
with a man called right here in the stadium where we
generated that's when we generated dc that's when dc happened yeah dc it was 1871 it was right after
lincoln's death lincoln put everything in the price to make that happen tell me what columbia is
district of columbia what is it it doesn't have anything to do with the country colombia who is colombia what are we talking
about what is columbia columbia river i want to know you know there's the same
columbia city
so i'm still wondering why they took your grandfather's
can you go and can you go after them now and give them a constitutional reason that they didn't have a right to take the gold and get it back
they'll say you weren't a party to it literally robbed at gunpoint everyone
there's an actual poster
so you can't go and fight for anything that a dead person lost you have no rights to the dead being
stolen under executive order of the president issued april 4th 1933 all persons are required to deliver
on or before may 1st 1933. that wasn't very much time
all gold coin gold bullion and gold certificates now owned by them to a federal reserve
bank branch or agency or to any member bank of the federal
reserve system by executive order criminal penalties for violation of the
executive order is a ten thousand dollar fine 10 years imprisonment or both as
provided as section 9 of this world if they did that what makes it so they
don't take our guns do the same thing what keeps them from taking their hands really us
you understand that's what that's the whole reason i'm here and how can we leverage i'm trying to teach the people
that they are not authority that they can try and do anything that they want to do
and it is up to us they operate by our consent if we allow it there's no statutory
limitations we can go back and sue them for what they did why not i want you to understand
sorry but that's just let's say there's about 40 000 people in
congress the senate west wing in the white house the president
upper judiciary there's about four you take the military out of it because i
believe they'd be on our side but in those other groups there's about 40 000.
our 2018 census so there's 327.2
you million of us with 400 guns with 400 million guns
okay okay whose fault is it if they take anything from us
out of their little bond fund they're suspecting that the government trillion a day in our court systems
let's rob them let's do what they do turn the
to do is learn camera you are from your status learn that you're alive
learn which jurisdiction you're in yeah and stand up and stop it that's all you have to do
is everything is about status standing in jurisdiction
everything violence is always a band-aid too it doesn't fix anything this is the right way to do it no but i
say we would just 327 million people unarmed
surrounded washington dc and held
no hands coming in no water is getting bottled the restaurants are going to be empty in
days nothing's coming in here no semi trucks no nothing no delivery of anything use
suckers are stuck right here in this 10 square miles because there's
327 million people hold tents around this 10 square mile area
and we refuse to
that's really all do we know how many population we have right now that are us initials yeah is there a way to know yeah tell us
10 years ago it's forty thousand now it's a little over four
nine years the vast majority of them are judges and attorneys yep
[Music] you're supposed to be with the moderator
buddy tell me what time it
[Music]
you made is
the doctors did
see me but didn't help lawyer would be
excited about helping and then do
nothing
or do something that was completely
wrong
you know what we've got to get good at
as people
is one once we recognize there's no
authority and they're trying to come
after us
it's how to shut them down just knock it
off you guys
you're operating outside your scope and
authority you're operating under the
killer a lot you're
you know all these little things i've
been bringing up over the last three
days
you can just start throwing them out
there like baseball's out
i can do that if i stop being if things
stop happening in my life yeah
but once you do that and you just start
slamming them
pretty soon you've got so much
ammunition in your pockets to fire back
at them they can't
do anything about it if you can keep it
short sweet and simple here's the one
thing i tell everybody you know the
reason why the
10 minute napkin presentation is you
will never have 10 minutes
more than 10 minutes in a car at a time
usually
so if you can't get it out of your mouth
what you're going to say
in a very short simple period of time
quickly
you're in trouble and that's why we do
everything
right because you can save more in
writing
than you can in a courtroom
a lot of times you'll get a couple
minutes they're trying to slam you guys
through like
right and they get they want to come in
and attempted to
even take a minute to breathe
if i do but then i won't even say that
like
you just lost all your rights it means
to
stand under the law that they're in
there's the chairs
yeah i don't know what i don't know
right
right that's what we're going to teach
and learn
it's a it's a crying chain we didn't
have a law class that kind of guarded
through
12th grade that's a lot of years of
education
and the minute you turn 16 you're
dealing with the law
usually because you got a driver's
license and you hadn't had
one single law class no one's going to
give you the education that you need to
agree
all right no it's not the point of the
education system the point of the
education system is to make compliant
workers
okay so what's our point how do we
change the education system
we call it something govern our public
service
that's one way teach your home
through play because actually there's
been studies that people
tend to remember things and understand
that it's through play
as opposed to just being told or shown
if you can do some sort of game with it
you can create something out of it that
has more power
that sticks with you it takes two or
four times two to four hundred times
to keep getting a break it's literally a
play that's when they call them acts
all these little points i'm making if
you draw those
diagrams and you put them on
million ways to teach our kids and
grandkids this stuff
i mean they show us it like they do
through the game of knucklebee
okay what other questions
otherwise we can quit early i want we
need to cover
student loan stuff and the difference is
private and
or like government loan versus student
loans are government while they're
compounded interested very few
private student loans hillsdale i think
through their foundation
system offers a private student loan for
people building hillside college
they don't take one cent from government
they don't accept government students
that's good but what if you have a
reference
you know what i don't know any other
option
i wish i did but if i am not paying
about ten thousand dollars a year in tax
then i feel much better about getting
around two thousand dollars
it is an expense yeah write it off your
taxes
so what if i don't have any liability in
taxes then you're not making enough
money
so lindsay you're something about that
student loan it's much like the doctor
knows it sounds like a jillion dollars
and they're showing you all the
penalties
as soon as you call them i'm paying off
student one is not even mine i'm
miffed about it too so as soon as you
call them you're like
look they say fine and they drop it down
to about a third of whatever they said
before and then they set up a payment
and um satisfaction that's how they said
that i have eight separate different
songs which
i never even took any answers i don't
know how to do that first place are they
coming every year every day school
they separate them and so now they're
trying to get me to do this
consolidation
and then they want me to do this whole
like well the the government will pay my
interest if i do that long but i don't
feel like i should put my
off on the taxpayer money so i've been
having my own ethical
moral dilemmas with that you know if you
could if you could borrow all the money
from the bank pay the student loan off
your payment would go and your balance
would go down much
faster your payment would be lower your
balance is good faster
and the reason why is the main interest
the bank computes the interest
differently than government student
wants compute
interest
student loans are based on compound
interest
so it's interest on top of interest on
top of interest you're paying
you're paying less than what the
interest on the loan is
so just keep that up
i paid for 18 years after i went to
college
and my balance was like
230 dollars less than when it started
yeah after 18 years so i walked in i
paid the whole thing
you could
i consolidate obviously
well it used to be sailing yeah it's
still a government skill
but it's still compounded the same
but isn't it
yeah that's a good way to put it they're
private for-profit businesses
acting as government
so they're not federal why can't you
point why not this the same as anything
else prove the claim
or pardon that's not i think but you
still did
you're still encouraged alone but what
about this compound interest is that
lawful
it is if they wrote it if they wrote it
and you signed it but
did you sign it not knowing what
compound interest was
interesting it is it is i mean i i'm
foreign
yeah but you paid for the education so
you've got to make sure that
trademark office if there's a patent on
student loans yeah but not the 3x
i don't think he should have three times
the same exactly
is that lawful that's where i would
fight it say you this compounds the
license
[Music]
any kind of banking or admiralty is
presumption assumption you're saying
consent
your consent so you you consented as a
signatory officer
they're holding you accountable because
you're an employee of government
assistance
or seen anyone using the passport number
for the
the other things that i was more
attracted to when i first started
getting it
opening some accounts uh you're
purchasing firearms with just your
passport number or
any of the other useful things my
firearms
and didn't get it i had oh oh that while
she was set up what was the uh
i looked up this uh 18 chapter uh
13451 or u1 e
and it looked like it was b2 he might be
getting us a little closer i was looking
for but i remember when he was reading
it out loud yesterday
it was the most wonderful verbiage and i
did not find it
that night wrong in my nose here it
might be
well like the page today that one single
page that he had had so
much wonderful reference on it but i
hope that
shows up an email longer yeah that was a
lot of need now
this is supposed to be the warrant
national defense code
usc 50 yeah it says code title 50
foreign national defense
trading with the enemy
i want to get all the way through this
affidavit of electoral
status
is that what you're calling it of
electoral status that's what you're
calling here
that's what you're calling your chamber
right so after i know that my passport
is reflecting the
1101 821 after i know that i think it
might be now but after i know for sure
after the affidavit
then the and i've already
negated my voter registration so that
have your emails start again
everything that differs fifty-two in
effect
verified
i just clicked
with the enemy
50 usc 4305 b2
any payment advanced transfer assignment
or delivery of property or interest
therein
made two or four in the account of the
united states or as otherwise directed
pursuant to this subdivision or any rule
regulation instruction or direction
issued here under shell to the extent
thereof
be a full acquaintance and discharge
for all purposes of the obligation of
the person making the same
you can use 50 usc we use
this exact thing in court cases for
quite a few years to get them to pay
things for us in court instead of the
defunct instead hdr192 issuer 192.
so that was usc 50 what was the
4305 b2
and no person shall be held liable in
any court
or or in respect to anything done
or admitted in good faith in connection
with the administration of
or in pursuance of and in reliance on
this subdivision or any
regulation instruction or direction
issued here entered
it was 4.12 usc 9582 and they moved it
to 50.
now under assignment you have to state
paid in the order of the united states
u.s treasury without recourse
and you have to accept for honor and pay
to the united states treasury
so i'll just the united states code
sounds
a lot closer to being successful with
that than uh
i'm looking at i am
just because so that i know how to find
this stuff so i'm looking at
450 us code 4305 and then go down to b2
b to any payment conveyance transfer
assignment or delivery of property or
interest they're in
is that what you said yeah oh okay
yes because this is a way to pay your
debts
through a court so are you saying my my
my college contribution that the judge
said i should have to pay she can pay it
herself yeah
but she's going to use myself either
come out of here
who cares
so anyway i just emailed them to you and
to you
you can share with them
yesterday you read i remember it was a
nice one-page sheet and it had this
amazing
yeah there's so many good things in usc
50.
um i i mean i'm just looking at my notes
and i literally have
thousands of thousands of those that
i've taken as i've been
studying over many many years and i just
typed in
5-0 up here and it pulled in all of
these
that have 5-0 in it
i have literally thousands of dollars if
i take that 5-0 out of there
my god we go on forever thousands and
thousands and thousands
and that's just since i started using
apple computers
previous microsoft stuff they're full
too
how many gigs do you have for that 300
some documents
well it's uh it's a bunch i think i paid
20
a month just to store it all on
how do you know
yeah but
so as far as free travel uh
do all of your contracts have to be in
honor before you negate them before you
present that so like your
uh license registration or your your
plain
registration does it have to be an honor
before we're sending that can it just
expire the new license
does that have to be somehow in honor
before you received
the contract you no longer use that you
know i've never cared about that
too much i i figure if you can explain
it
well enough it doesn't matter what
position it's in over time
fraud initiates everything from the
beginning at the moment the wheel fell
off the way
which is the moment fraud is recognized
so you can go along with abroad for
years and
if you've never hauled pastures for hire
you weren't an uber driver or bus driver
or taxi driver
and you never hauled goods for resale
interstate commerce
and you've never been a public servant
in the performance of their public
duties
then in all these years you've had a
driver's license
it's been throbbed yeah but there are
certain things you need like
driver's licenses you
between jurisdictions right so if i'm
operating in that jurisdiction
drive my truck semi with a lot of hay i
show
the police officer for my driver's
license
when i'm not there's no way on earth
that
that's ever going to know i have one
i'm going to show him my password and
here's why i just found it it was b2e
not b1e
federally protected activities traveling
in or using
any facility of interstate commerce or
using any vehicle terminal or
facility of any common carrier by motor
rail water or air
federally protected your right to travel
so you can see these
i can plug it into my iphone or i can
plug it into a usb
yeah 250 gigs
right here from the cloud yeah i can
download
everything on there onto this so or
that's 250k right now this is 250 gigs
yeah
isn't that amazing like i you know
worked for a pretty company when i
they had the first big drive it was like
an hr tape
yeah my first job out of school was
fathom technologies and overnight we did
as400s and system 36 as you remember
mainframes
so overnight i sold backup drives these
backup drives within eight hours
could save 250 megabytes
overnight and you have these videotapes
that it
saved to and then there was off-site
entire industry that would come pick up
your videotapes and take them off-site
in case your building beared down so all
your data was
let
my first business i started in college
was an advertising agency
i bought one of the very first apple
computers an apple printer
and a scanner to do graphics on
for advertising
to eat it was 32 000 worth
insert disc 52 insert disc 53
in 1995 when i
partnered with rick morrell to do that
subdivision in redmond
i spent 30 35 000
on a tripod with a piece of equipment
with a handheld receiver
that was built by a company called the
auto light
that was accurate to record where my
my lots that i was plotting out on this
big piece of property i've plotted lots
35 000 worth of equipment and walking
around
okay for 3.99
[Music]
same exact company oh my gosh this gives
you more information it hooks to the
camera i can drop a quarter off if i had
a quarter
i drop a quarter on the floor we'll use
the tile corners
and i can step my camera over it
i've got the exact gps coordinates of
this corner of that title
down to six decimals below the decimal
six numbers below the discipline
accurately
if i move it an eighth of an inch it's
changed
that's how accurate this is now it's
tied into my camera
i can do a screenshot on a property
corner
you can change it i can go like this and
point towards the other property corner
i can walk to the other property corner
i can do the same thing
i can get all four and i've got the gps
coordinates
i've got the azimuth the true elevation
i've got
everything so i've got a compass heading
i've got everything on here and it all
shows up on the screenshot
it's one of the most amazing tools i've
ever seen this right here for 3.95
surveyors are out of business what's it
called that what's it called
i i can pull down the bottom edge of
that wall
and i can measure how tall that was
oh my gosh i need that what is that
called what's that
the auto light it was designed for the
military
and eventually they let surveyors use it
and then now everybody
you know your math teacher told you well
you're not always going to have a
calculator on youtube
now i'll have a computer
all right any more questions a million
but i can't yeah
i guess i don't know how to spell it can
you spell it because i have the
auto and it's not so i'm not selling it
correctly in the app store
th
now it says there's in-app purchases
you're not gonna have to
have in-app purchases to use basic
yourself because i actually just
downloaded one and i have the
legal report
no
like a couple months ago when i was
spraying my
i think we should sit down this week and
work on that david's yes
where'd you get a template for yours
yeah
yes
