hey this is Brad Tipton and I'm reaching out because over the past several months
I've had over 500 requests for folks to learn how to well looking for me to help
them to leverage their q-sip to discharge debt and so I really hadn't
planned to do any training like that at all this year I ended at that at the end of last year but when you get so many
people let me let me show you what I mean to give you an idea hopefully I can pull this up here
while I'm using this recording screen let me see if I can pull it up
here uh when you see the ones that says me
this is where I've responded to somebody but when you see just the name right there that's where the and you'll see
the word either q-sip or mortgage payoff or q-sip or q-sip or q-sip or qsip
that's what they're looking for so they're reaching out and that's what it is so if you look at these you'll see as
I go up just just person after person after person after person after person after person after person after person
looking for information on the q-sip and it just blew me away and as you can just
see I'm still scrolling and I'm just still scrolling and there's still people and still people still people and so I
said look I mean I said look if I I need to put something together to help these folks because if they don't they're
going to go and deal with somebody online who has no idea what they're talking about so my motivation for doing
this was even though I wanted to stop doing it as of last year and move in a different direction completely in my
legal services business this year I decided look I'm going to help folks because I don't want you going to the
wrong places and getting the wrong information about how to leverage your Q7 and utilize it to discharge debt so
that's what it is so also if you know me you know I'm I've written several books
I'm really good at creating websites and digital things like that and so it usually looks really nice but
because I'm just kind of putting this together off the cuff it it doesn't look that great when as I explained to you
what it is so let's get into it I know your time is valuable for if you don't know who I am my name is Brad Tipton
I am the one who created this program where I can help you to discharge any debt without you having to do anything
but sign your name and drop a letter in the mail right I created that program it's called the acceptance pathway
process I created that process where you just simply create a letter drop it in the mail and debt is discharged and
that's how it goes so I created that program I also created this uh several books this is called how to fight a
non-judicial foreclosure in court and when I wrote that book uh here's another one a simple step-by-step process to
avoid any past or present court case or judgment I wrote that book uh how to make any debt disappear in 30 days or
less I wrote that book how to use quantum grammar to remove that using the language to do it I wrote
the book on how to find your q-sip number how to use use the uh the birth certificate qsit number how to find that
I wrote the book called How to vacate a judgment a practical guide to understand and vacating a past judgment I wrote
that book um man I wrote the book how to stop a foreclosure in three simple steps even
if the share of sale is already done and you're still living in the property other things I've done out here
help you to get your court case dismissed within 14 days by filling out a simple one-page document or you pay
nothing I show folks how to do that other stuff that I and I own a legal
legal services business which is where I really wanted to focus my attention this year uh but when folks started reaching
out to me saying hey Brad how do I use my qsub to discharge debt at first for like the first 10 15 20 50 100 people I
was like look I'm not in that industry this year I'm not not helping with that this year but once I get over 500 folks
reaching out to me again I want to show you the emails I don't want you to think that I'm fabricating it or something
along those lines these are actual folks reaching out to me asking for help on
with their q q right those are real folks reaching out
to me asking for help regarding the accusative and so I want to just say look I put together a program and I'm
reaching out because some people say oh Brad you're creating a program because you just want more money
man trust me I with my legal services business I want you know I charge 15 for
15 minutes it's one is one thousand dollars for 15 minutes right so it's four thousand dollars an hour so by
creating this program it's not a money grab it's either I'm going to show you how to do it properly or you're going to
go to somebody and learn how to do it wrong you're going to pay them and you're not going to get the result so that's why I created this program I
wanted to educate you I wanted to empower you and I want to protect you that's my reasons for doing it so
um that's it so the brand new program for me is called the Q sub King debt
discharge training program called accusative King debt discharge training program and
um and I'm using what I call my rest process my rest process to leverage your
birth certificate q-sip and discharge the debt and it's my our EST process rest because it shouldn't be hard it's
some it shouldn't be something that you're working hard to do so when I say the rest process it's r e s t right
that's where I got it from but the first thing I always do in all of my programs even with my current Legal Services
business where I charge 15 a thousand dollars for 15 minutes of my time I
still utilize the rapid reversal technology that I invented and that
technology is where in the public Arena whenever they're going to do something
to you you will notice they will always send you a letter a document in the mail
and with my rapid reversal technology I take that same document
turn it around and use it against them to get the result that I want that's
called my rapid reversal technology where I take the thing that they sent to
me to harm me I turn that around and use the same energy in that thing to get the
result That I Want from them or it harms them and that's called my rapid reversal
technology for instance just to give you an idea what happens is and we'll talk about
this a little bit so let's go on to eat so e is where we establish a contract with
them using administrative process so many folks that I've seen out there using administrative process have no
idea about how to properly use an administrative process because when I
look at their letters there's two things that's missing it never forms a proper contract and there's no there's no terms
in it for if they fail to respond because sometimes you'll send an administrative process and they'll just completely dismiss you they won't even
give you the time of day they'll just mistreat you like you didn't do anything to them and what I
find is if you don't have a mechanism inside your administrative process the the statement that says if you don't get
back to me then this happens right to you then if you're missing that then
then your your administrative process has no it has nothing that happens to them there's no
repercussions to them if they don't get back to you or if they fail to discharge your your debt you have to have in the
contract a portion of it that says look if you don't get back to me if you don't reply if you don't comply then this is
what happens to you and if it's missing that piece you got nothing it has no your administrative process has no teeth
is what I call it it has no enforcement mechanism on the inside of it and so
what I do is I I utilize the document that they sent to me and I help and I
provide you with all everything that you need the templates and everything so the templates are all included in here if I didn't write it please know you get the
fill in the blank templates where you just plop in your name your you sign it the date and whatever you mail it and you're good to go with your
administrative process so the first letter is called so when let's say they send you a monthly mortgage statement
this is just an example it could be a car note it could be a student loan it could be a credit card it could be whatever I'm just saying so with the non
the first letter we so they let's say they send you a monthly mortgage statement so you always want to respond back with
what's called a non-negotiable notice of conditional acceptance where in that non-negotiable notice of the conditional
acceptance you have your terms and conditions uh where they agree to accept your q-sip
uh in 10 days for to accept your if where if they
don't get back to you in reply within 10 days then they are agreeing to accept your q-sip um and your promissory note to settle
and discharge the debt and if they don't get back to you they're agreeing to pay you a fee of like ten thousand dollars
right I usually I've never gotten that actual money it's just the threat of it
that makes them do it uh so anyway so the first letter is the non-negotiable notice of a conditional acceptance with
your terms and conditions in it and you give them 10 days to reply nine times out of ten they're not going to reply or
do anything that you ask that's fine so because of their failure to reply and do
what you ask you send the second later letter that says okay now you are in Fault
you have faulted by failing to get back to me right and let me give you an
opportunity to cure your wrongdoing so let me give you 10 additional days to answer the
questions in my first letter um
you know so it's like let me get back to you and give you 10 additional days to answer the the questions and the things that I've requested in my first letter
otherwise you're agreeing to my terms and conditions like the terms and conditions where I can utilize my q-sip
to create a promissory note instead of the debt that kind of thing so give them 10 more days
again nine times out of ten they're not going to reply to you so use some of the non-negotiable notice of default where
it says okay you have defaulted I contacted you once you to get back to me properly I
contacted you twice and give you more time to get back to me properly third letter says you didn't get back to me properly therefore you have agreed
that I owe you nothing uh that you're going to set my account balance to zero that you're going to clean up my credit
that you're going to send me my free and clear title and you're going to pay me ten thousand dollars you've agreed to that by your failure to get back to me
right those are just kind of some of the terms and conditions right and what you've done with this is you created
what I call a legal contract uh if you've ever been in a situation where you owe money to a lender or debt
collector like they will send you the first letter the second letter and the third letter and if you don't reply back
properly then they will repossess your car or they will garnish your wages or they will foreclose in your house or
whatever it is right so it's this three letter process which we refer to as the
administrative process it's this three-letter process that the whole world recognizes
that creates a contract right so what I find is that
here the goal of course you want the debt discharge there are a small chance or 20
where they will just simply discharge the debt and go away and you're good on that other 80 they're not going to give
you the time of day but your goal you have to think strategically and not just tactically you have to think
strategically you have to go in your mind and understand that the purpose of sending this administrative process
these three letters wasn't necessarily to discharge the debt it was to create
the contract that is enforceable in court if they don't settle and discharge the
debt right so you need so if you ever need to go to court you can say look I have a contract where they have agreed
that I owe them nothing where they have agreed to set my account balance at zero where they've agreed to send me my free
and clear title where they've agreed to clean up my credit and clean up any negative reporting right and they've
agreed to pay me ten thousand dollars but what will happen in court is if you don't have the process in place where
they've agreed to that then there's no contract and you can't enforce it the judge can't enforce what you don't set
up so this is designed to set it up so that when you ask for what's called
summary judgment of the ten thousand dollars the title of the house or the car debt removal set
the account balance to zero if you haven't done The Upfront work with this then the judge can't
give it to you you have to remember that judges and courts are what's called um public servants
and so many people have they get such a bad rep because folks in the living in the private uh Community or in the
Sovereign Citizen Community they don't do The Upfront work properly then they go into court and they wonder why the
judge doesn't give them what they want it's because they didn't do the work because they didn't they didn't think strategically right they just went in
there talking about I'm a sovereign citizen I don't owe anything yeah they wouldn't take your house if you do stupid stuff like that right so you have
to set up things properly and establish a contract where they've agreed to your terms and conditions so that when you
submit that into the court the judge is like well they established a contract didn't you get his first letter well I
got a judge but I just blew it off oh did you get a second letter yeah judge but you know how it is no did you get
his third letter yes did you pay his invoice well no and the judge's gonna be
like get out of here my judgment is for Brad Tipton for settling the account
setting it to zero giving him a title to his house or car or whatever it is paying him ten thousand dollars he's got
a contract here right so the entire public world is about contract and if you don't do the
work up front to set up the contract then you can never enforce it in court and there are going to be
times where you're going to need to enforce your discharge in court but you have to do the work up front and I provide you with all of the templates
all of the fill in the blank templates all in the training everything that you need to video training and everything to
set that up so you're in perfect shape right the other so that's the so that's
the rapid reversal is the r the E is established the the contract S is to
settle the entire debt with them now most folks don't understand this I'm going to show you something because
I'm going to show you something where most folks would never show you this because they don't even know about it
I'm gonna show you something uh where is that here okay
I'm gonna as you likely already know any debt or anything that you receive Bill
invoice whatever is called a presentment because it's being presented to you if you don't know that
now you do right and what we're looking at here is what's called Black's Law Dictionary and I want to pull this up so
you know what is Black's Law Dictionary
so you know what we're looking at so this is the different blacks law dictionaries that come out over the
years I believe this one or this one is the most current I have downloaded mine
that's how I like to do it so I don't have to carry a big old fat book around right but uh let's see it was first
published in 1891 uh
let me just see here it is for more than a century Black's Law
Dictionary has been the gold standard not the bronze standard not the wooden standard not the silver standard right
it is the gold standard for the language of law today it is the
most widely not the kind of widely it is the most widely cited law book in the
world right not Miriam Webster not anything else not any other law book this is the
gold standard this is the gold standard why do I say that because when I show it
to you you have to understand that it's like the Bible in a courtroom it is the
Bible in a courtroom Black's Law so you have to make sure that anything that you
do you do it in accordance with Black's Law because that's where they're going to look it up so let's look up the word presentment
I think that's on page 1062 or something like that where are we at 1064.
Oh I thought it was 1062.
uh please presentment
I think I went too far let me go back up a little bit sorry but I mean that's fine so at least
you know I've got the actual book here right
here it is presentment now if you want to you can stop this video I'm not going to read this entire
thing I'm just going to get to the good part right and the good part is everything that I'm sharing with you has
right here you see this highlighted part that's that Supreme Court case law
right so I'm not talking about something that I dreamed up this is out of Black's Law Dictionary
the most widely cited law book on the planet and out of that I'm quoting from
Supreme Court case law here as well as here
okay and it also has the UCC where the rules guidelines the UCC says it as well
so Black's Law says it the Supreme Court says what I'm about to share with you and the UCC says what I'm about to say
to you so it's not my something I pulled obscure so like I
said I'm gonna I'm gonna skip to the bottom a presentment is a demand
but you already know this you already know that when you receive your monthly mortgage statement in the mail or car
note in the mail or credit card student loan whatever it is you know that when you get that in the mail it's not a
Hallmark greeting card you already know it's a demand what I'm about to share with you is I
don't know if you know what it's a demand for so it says a presentment is a demand for
this right or
this right so let me highlight the whole thing together so we see it together
so in other words you're saying when you receive your monthly mortgage statement it's a demand for acceptance
or payment now most folks understand payment of
course but most folks don't understand acceptance right and that's because you can do an
acceptance because typically with that monthly mortgage statement or whatever it is there's a coupon with it
and if you don't properly accept it and return it to them
then the debt can't get discharged right so most folks understand that when
you receive a presentment yes it's a demand but it's a demand for one of two things
payment or acceptance
one or the other not both right you can't do both so if you're going to do payment don't try to do
acceptance if you're going to do acceptance don't try to do payment it's or I didn't write this
Black's Law wrote it so acceptance or payment great so what it's saying is
that you got to learn how to accept the coupon that they send to you
and and many of you you've already I know you've already heard that the question is how do you do that perhaps that's what
this program is all about to tell you how to settle
the entire debt according to Acceptance in Black's Law how do you do that is
what people want to know from me right so you have to understand again we have to go with the definitions that are in
the legal world not from some uh Sovereign citizen web page or some
living in the private Guru or some what you can't go by that stuff
you gotta use what the world what the public what the courts use you have to
use their tools if you want to get the outcomes that they can give you
right so here's what I did now I don't know if you understand what AI is it's called artificial intelligence it helps
me to cut down research and all kind of stuff it can I can put a term in the internet it can search the entire
internet while I'm well I would just be studying one page it can search the entire
Internet and get me my answer like that it's called Auto AI artificial
intelligence so I utilize that so I said well what is a coupon
according to Burton's legal thesaurus because Burton's just like you use typically you use um Merriam-Webster's
Dictionary then you use the thesaurus to look up kind of other words well in the same thing they use uh they use Black's
Law Dictionary and they use Burton's thesaurus to kind of look up the synonyms of a word anyway I use that in
Ai and it said that hey according to Miriam Webster and according to this thesaurus a coupon because usually they
send you a coupon right with your monthly mortgage statement right with your student loan whatever it is um they see the coupon a coupon is a
slip a ticket or certificate it is also coupon is also called a
voucher voucher you're like okay Brad what does that to do with anything you got to go back to
Black's Law here's the V book The V section of Black's Law let's blow it up
because once you understand what a voucher is you're going to win and this program is designed to help you
do that so this program is designed to provide
you with the the backdrop where where other people say things but they never tell you the how to do it this program
provides you with the step by step how to do it you know what it what is what
are the steps how do you do it and I have a team here that will be
answering your questions they're available 24 7 via email I have a legal team that's here to help you so you you
can't go wrong with this uh need to go down further I'm sorry
voucher here it is in Black's Law all right now I'm not again you can stop
the video and read it yourself I'm just gonna kind of get to the big to the good part right
a voucher now remember your monthly mortgage statement or car note or whatever it is student loan credit card
it comes with a coupon a voucher right with it
and it says the the voucher is a receipt it's an acquittance
remember again we're using a legal world have you ever heard somebody that was acquitted of a crime
well the voucher is your acquittance it's also your release from the debt it
is also evidence of payment but the voucher is again the voucher is
your
discharge of a debt the voucher is the key to the discharge
of the debt right it's the voucher right it's the voucher
check this out a voucher is a document that does two
things it recognizes the liability right so let's say you owe a hundred
thousand dollars on your house the voucher recognizes the liability that you owe
and what else does it do Brad it authorizes the disbursement of cash
what it recognizes the liability the voucher
the coupon that's on your monthly mortgage statement or whatever the voucher
recognizes the liability and it authorizes the disbursement of
the cash so that's the power of this uh this part of the program
ow to utilize that coupon right to
acknowledge the debt you know have the debt collector acknowledge of that and release the disbursement of the cash to
settle it this program shows you how I provide the
videos of course I'm not doing it because I everybody's got a different time frame so I put it on video so that
you can log into the password protected training area you can watch it when you're when you're some people are like
morning people some people like night people uh so you gotta do the training when it's right for you
right the other thing is that some people are on the go so they need the ability to watch it on their on their
smartphone so it's mobile friendly it's mobile ready all the templates are there all the downloads are there you just
download them fill in the blanks and follow the instructions and mail it in and sign it you're good to go right so
everything is there for you right so use the rapid reversal see
again this is my rest program process I want you to just take it easy
not stress you've got all the support that you need you've got me you got the
videos you got the downloads you've got the templates you've got my customer service team you've got my legal support
team you've got it all so you can just rest you can just relax take it easy
all right so anyway I show you how to settle the entire debt by using the acceptance process that's mapped out in
Black's Law right so once you do that once you've accepted the debt and discharged it and
then once you've gotten your proper um uh administrative process that sets
up the contract then they should go ahead and dismiss and discharge the debt
but you want me to tell you something sometimes it's just completely ignore you
and I don't I can't tell you how many people reach out to me saying Brad I did the administrative process and they
ignored me they won't do it and now they're taking me to court or they're just taking my house or they're repossessing my car I did the
administrative Pride it's because your administrative process didn't have any teeth
it didn't have the ability right to take them to court and enforce
your discharge if necessary right so I want you to know that
the t r e s t is we help you take them
to court if necessary right we handle all your court documents why because I own a complete where is it
here I own a complete Legal Services Company
right so I've got I've got us right here I mean I've got all the helps help that
you need right here I own a complete Legal Services Company
right so you're not Wonder so let's say you have to take them to court how do you write up the motion how do you fill
out the documents how do you get summary judgment against them how do you how do you how do you how do you I got a team
that walks you through that so that you can rest so that you can relax so that you can chill
right we do that for you
that's why it's called the rest program you rest we help
so if you need to take them to court we handle all the court documents we write up all your initial complaint
right if they respond we shut them down in court because a lot of times they'll send their attorneys
um they'll send their attorneys this that and the other and we shut the attorney down like that
no problem but if they don't respond we need to put in the proper motion for summary
judgment and the Judgment needs to be for two things judgment for complete
discharge of the debt and the Judgment for the fee that they agreed to pay
up here when we did the administrative process most times uh you won't get to
ten thousand dollars it's good to ask for right so our goal is to make sure that you do
everything possible so so that you stay protected right that's what this program
is about it's called my newest program is called the Q sub King
debt discharge training program and it's using my rest process to use your birth
certificates cue set to discharge the debt we use my rapid reversal technology
right where we take the documents they sent to us turn them around and use them against them to get use them against
like let's say it's a bank they send you the monthly mortgage statement we utilize that right because
the coupon is on there we turn it around and actually get to get the discharge we
reverse it right we establish a contract with them by the administrative process a proper
administrative process where we establish a contract so that if we ever need to go to court
we have a contract that we can enforce where we can say judge we've established a contract they breached the contract
please go ahead and give us summary judgment in our favor but if you don't set this up properly
you can't go to court properly and win right then we settle the entire debt where we utilize right like we saw in
Black's Law the coupon the voucher which is your release which is your discharge
right to settle the entire dead it's beautiful and then if for any reason they give you
any pushback or they don't do what you ask or demand or comp command or they don't comply in any way then our team my
team does all the work to provide you with all the documents that you need and in most cases just be as straight as
that possible with you we do everything so that you don't even actually have to um
go into the courtroom to settle the debt and get get the result that you want we want to do everything by paper we want
to get summary judgments we don't do motions and all that kind of stuff and that's how we do it and we have our team
to do that for you but if you do ever have to go into the courtroom we show you how to show up in what's called special appearance
I've heard of so many people doing Special appearance and 99.99999 knives and people have no idea
about how to show up in court um by special appearance for instance when you show up in special appearance you
only ask questions you never answer questions the moment that you answer question right you are no longer in
special appearance and you open yourself up to harm from the court right so you want to do that so we we
walk through the entire process with you so our goal with this program is very
simple we want to educate you
