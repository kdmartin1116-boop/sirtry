it's Mark Yi here wealth architect and lifestyle investor let's take your life to the next level welcome to the wealth architect podcast hey everybody it's Mark Yi welcome to another wealth architect podcast today we have an epic epic probably our longest and maybe most thorough episode that we've done here on the wealth architect podcast glad you're here I have a co-host on this one there's so much work involved in this one that Nicholas spone is co-hosting with me if you know him from this the

history of this podcast he's been on before uh Nick is a podcaster and a hypnotist and uh just an all-around great guy good friend of mine and uh we hosted a really great podcast a few minutes ago and it went a long time went over four hours and I tell you it was really really amazing it was um it was a guy named Brandon Joe Williams who's a little irreverent a little outside the box or a lot outside the box but so much information is in there that I'm highly recommending you watch it what do you

think Nick what what what do you think we learned in that well that was a marathon and uh yeah Brandon Joe Williams is kind of one of our favorite uh characters and uh he's a super passionate guy about law and finances and uh Securities and negotiable instruments and there were so many gems in this um there you know there's a lot of content because it was what four and a half hours yeah um but to understand what a US citizen is how to change our statuses how to how we get into contracts the definitions of money and

persons it really te it's really going to teach these listeners Mark how to navigate through this world yeah and I I think if you're listening you're going to want to watch the AUD the video version of this because there's so many definitions and things that Brandon put on the screen in this and by the way one of the biggest things is that we are you know and it's going to sound funky because you know this is what we run into and what Brandon runs into all the time but how to not pay taxes why that

we're sucked into the banking system and the tax system and even the property ownership system because we're taught a certain way and we're afraid of bucking that system because of what they think what we think will happen based on what they've told us will happen if we try to do something outside the system and listen if you if you've been around for the last five years you know that there's some questions and some holes and some some chinks in the armor of this Matrix so uh we're asking the

questions Brandon Joe Williams our great guest was on there to to answer him for us Mark I think everybody everybody in this country kind of knows there's something wrong right like that's right there's something wrong with how they print and spend money there's there's something wrong you know where I don't think people feel like they have their constitutional rights like they like they should and so we all know there's something wrong and and Brandon kind of blows the the common Paradigm out of the water

and explodes it so we can say oh this is what's wrong and this is how we start to take our freedom and our finances and our sovereignty back let's uh let's kind of close this quick little intro up by saying we had some fun we learned some stuff if you have an open mind on the next four and a half hours but if you have an open mind you're going to learn some stuff for yourself and you might even improve your life or at least the life of the of the family that that you leave behind so without further Ado

welcome again to the wealth architect podcast thanks again to Nick and here is Brandon Joe Williams all right we have Brandon Joe Williams with us today and uh we are ready to rock and roll so hey Brandon welcome to the show wel wealth architect podcast and Nicholas spone is GNA be uh be doing a little bit of pitching and catching with me and we're going to be talking to Brandon and uh we're gonna let Brandon kind of run with it because he's got about thousands of hours of doing this so welcome to the

show Brandon thanks guys I appreciate you uh having me on the show yeah sure yeah we'll just we'll just jump right into it red hot I don't know if you guys have seen um my new flowchart uh screen sharing is not turned on I'm going to send a request to you right now got it go ahead so this is my new this is going to be very overwhelming for new people but it's going to help me to be able to get through a lot of the information more rapidly if we have this up right so so basically what I do for people who

are new uh is is you know I know a lot of what Mark talks about and stuff like that he told me before the show he's got an older audience you know like for example uh I don't know if you've ever heard Mark of the book uh Leading Edge Boomers and seniors by Dan S Kennedy you ever heard of that book before I know a lot of Dan Kennedy stuff but not that book so it's a whole book about the demographic and and half of every dollar and actually after Co it's probably more like 55 or 60 cents of every dollar is

held by uh the Leading Edge Boomers and seniors demographic the older uh older older individuals in their 60 plus range and basically he says that if you aren't specifically working towards that particular demographic and to deliver value to that particular demographic you're basically blowing your own leg off with a shotgun essentially right so yeah I did the same thing I started gearing all of my businesses and everything that I have towards that demographic as well so in terms of that

demographic and in terms of what you teach uh everyone wants to make money everyone wants to hold money and protect money but nobody really knows anything about what money actually really is so that's really the presentation that I do and it's usually pretty shocking even for wealthy people because they realize very very rapidly that they had absolutely no idea what was in these these quote unquote bank accounts or this quote unquote wallet in their pocket and it's actually uh uh so

shocking in fact that it can be upsetting uh so just to kind of start off and just kind of explain a few things about Contracting and how contracts work and this is really important for any businessman obviously people think to themselves oh know what a contract is and this and that um well you you'd be shocked I was shocked I'm still learning what a contract is even to this day and I've been doing this all day every day since September of 2021 so so all contracts require consideration people often assume or

even offer a contract without you totally understanding what is happening or you ignore the offer which can be assumed to mean you acques right and I have the capital words means that there's a definition for that word up above right so the definition of contract is an agreement upon sufficient consideration to do or not do a particular thing so Brandon Aquas is like a tacit contract right well I'm going to go through from the beginning and we're going to go through each of these Capital words uh and then we're

going to reread the sentence Okay cool so a contract is an agreement upon sufficient consideration to do or not to do a particular thing right so you ask yourself well what's consideration of course that's the next word consideration is not to be confounded with motive consideration means something which is a value in the eyes of the law moving from the plaintiff either of benefit to the plaintiff or of detriment to the defendant right and this is really really important nothing is consideration that is not regarded as

such by both parties so for example you guys think that you know most people think that Federal Reserve notes which is those green pieces of paper that are in your wallet or your bank account are extremely valuable uh they are uh in in sort of a weird delusionary way but when you start understanding more and more about money you start to understand that they're really not and it's sort of like in my opinion the way I look at all of this information is sort of like women right if you are just all over the woman and

you make the woman your whole life and this and that they you you think in your mind especially when you're younger you think that's what they want and they may even say that they want that right but then when you start doing that they they start to lose interest and the reason why that is because I took me 20 years to figure that out too uh the reason why that is is because they they the the whole the whole drive and thrusting energy of a man into the world trying to complete some sort of massive project or

something that he really believes in is the sexiest thing in the world to a woman right and when you when you replace that with her and her and her whims and desires you think to yourself logically that makes sense but in in actual practice it doesn't really work that way um you know the the the the the place that keeps a woman most attractive is by you being the most attractive man duh right and the most attractive man is a man who the way that Zan perion defines it in the book The Alabaster

girl which is my favorite book in the whole world and I'm a member of the amarati of the group the way he defines it is is is an undying Focus and and loyalty to to a goal or project that is bigger than himself right so the whole point of of consideration in terms of money is you can actually make a lot more of it when when you aren't worshiping it and making it your whole life it's actually kind of a weird reversal of thoughts people are running around trying to figure out money money

money how do we get more of it all the time uh but when you actually just relax and and when you actually just you you you are the king of money and that's the end of the [ __ ] story you have to understand money to get into that mind frame when you get into that mind frame it's no different than like for example with women and then all of a sudden women are coming out of the woodwork trying to talk to you and they're attracted to you you attract it's like uh Dan S Kennedy all his stuff is about

attracting money attracting attention marketing that attracts it's attractive Market it's literally his whole system is called like attractive marketing or whatever right so rather than chasing you're attracting right and the only way that you can get into that mind frame in any area of your life is by really really having a lot of knowledge understanding and a good relationship with whatever it is that you're trying to attract whether it's women or money or whatever right so yeah getting back

into this consideration nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties what that means is it's it's it's very obvious when you talk about it for a minute uh if if I try to give you a car it's piece of [ __ ] you don't want it there's no contract because a contract is an agreement upon sufficient consideration to do or not to do a particular thing right and then we have adequate consideration one which is not so disproportionate as to shock our sense

of that morality and fair dealing which should always characterize transactions between man and man right so so so what does that mean that just means you know you can't trick someone into giving you their car for a dollar you can't trick someone you know that's that's that would that would shock our sense of morality and fair dealing you see yep but it's it's a hard it's it's a very very uh uh complicated and and in-depth situation because every single person has a different idea of

what's valuable so that's why that's why Contracting and that's why law is so complicated because everyone considers different things to be valuable and then everyone considers those things to be valuable to different levels some people may consider something to be kind of valuable or barely valuable or not valuable or terribly valuable whatever right yeah and those things change too so so that's you know another thing about like marriage and stuff like that it's amazing people can be married in my

opinion I mean I'm not I'm not anti-marriage it's just a a thought towards the the the illustriousness of man I guess you could say because all all of these considerations and all of these thoughts and all of these things and all of these values are always shifting throughout people's life too so you have two people or even business partners and their value shift and then now what you know what I mean it's pretty wild actually when you start to think of how all this uh plugs into

human human interaction it's it's it's amazing that anything can happen in the world really yeah you take two people you stick them in a house together and they got to agree on the toilet paper going over or under and they got to have the same values and they got to be on the same page business-wise a lot of things can go wrong right yeah it's it's pretty wild um so so all contracts require consideration that's the first sentence so now that makes sense right so so in order for there to be an

agreement there has to be some sort of something of value in order for their that that's exchanged from one party to the other um right so people often assume or even offer a contract without you totally understanding what is happening so so what does assume mean to take on become bound as another is bound or put oneself in place of another as to an obligation or liability right so this is a pretty shocking definition that very few people know anything about again these are all legal definitions uh but the thing is is that

they're they're active in a lot more areas of your life than you would think which is why uh which is the basis of my entire platform my entire platform is basically an occult platform uh occult means you know that which is hidden and uh everyone is sort of in the occult without them knowing it and my job and what I do in my platform is to basically help you to see that you are in the occult and then to kind of move up and out of that through understanding various symbols and words Etc okay uh

which sounds very creepy and weird uh but it's actually very mainstream because I specialize in things like legal contracts uh fin cial instruments Etc okay yeah so become bound as another is bound put on self in place of another as to an obligation or liability literally it literally means like if I owe money to the bank and I like swap you for me and now like you're in my place and you're the one who owes the money that's called assume so Brandon I I do this a lot with my real estate so

when we have consideration in a contract that might mean I put up $100,000 you put up a house and we swap and so we're both offering consideration and within that there may even be you know an assumption of where I assume your liability for that note does that sound right simp because the thing is is that as we're going to get into later in the show you you don't have any liability over that note you the fact that you manufactured that note completes the contract and completes the Assumption

and completes the obligation or liability and that's the part that no one knows that's the part that literally just the the the judges think I'm crazy the the prosecutors think I'm crazy the banks act like I'm crazy they know better and it's just the thing is is that when you we'll get into that later though because it's going to it's going to divert me into a whole different direction which we're not going to go into that quite yet but basically to assume means to to put someone in a

position of obligation or liability uh where where someone else is actually the one bound to it and and you're you're becoming bound at another is bound right y definition of offer is to bring to or before to present for acceptance or rejection to hold out or profer to make a proposal to to exhibit something that may be taken or received or not which isn't terribly far from what people probably think the definition of the word offer is but it's always good to review yep um so let's reread this

people often assume or or even offer a contract without you totally understanding what is happening or you ignore the offer which can be assumed to mean you acques acquiescence right here right acques means to give an implied consent to a transaction to the acral of a right or to any act by one's mere silence or without Express aent or acknowledgement so what does that mean this is really confusing for people people in law what this means is if you if you are given uh an offer if someone brings or presents something for

acceptance or rejection and you fail to reject said thing it can be considered legally to be implied consent to a transaction now how does that work if there wasn't adequate consideration or sufficient consideration agreed upon well that would be that would be where litigation would begin that would be the opening statements that would be where litigation would essentially begin right so so the way this kind of boils down if you want to go into uh more detail on it is we start getting into the Rules of

Evidence right and if we start getting into the Rules of Evidence involving presumptions preum presumptions in a civil case right rule 301 right so so in a civil case unless a federal statute or the or or these rules provide otherwise the party against whom a presumption is directed has the burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption so this is this right here and is basically all of litigation in one sentence and this right here is basically the reason why everyone hates lawsuits this is the reason why everyone

hates lawsuits because what lawyers do is they just cook up complete hor [ __ ] y endlessly and the reason why is because this is why they do that they do that because every single time they do that if you fail to produce evidence and rebut it you lose so you wind up on this endless defense position just getting machine guned into [ __ ] dust every single time and how do you get around this you got to do the same thing to them no well well I suppose you could but no the the way that you get around

this is you go down to uh rule rule 402 tells you relevant evidence is admissible unless any of the following right um uh irrelevant EV evidence is not admissible that's the main point right and then how do you get evidence on the record right because once you get evidence on the record presumption the presumption game ends it's like snipping their dick off right yeah and the way that you do that is 602 and 603 602 need for personal knowledge a witness May testify to a matter only if evidence is

introduced uh sufficient to support a finding that the witness had personal knowledge of the matter so what happens is that the the lawyers are pretending as though they have personal knowledge they're pretending as though they are a witness and the thing is in order for them to do that as per rule 603 before testifying a witness must give an oath or air affirmation to testify truthfully it must be in a form designated to imp press that Duty on the witness's conscience and we also have rules of professional conduct rule

number 3.7 which says that basically lawyers are not are not allowed to act as uh Witnesses and Advocates they have to choose one or the other right but but Brandon they're gonna they're going to try to do that right you have to stop them and object in the process right you have to stop them so a lawyer shall not act as Advocate at a tri in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness so so if they are a witness you can cross-examine them if they are a witness they have to submit affidavits

right they they don't do that they submit only declarations and their declarations are filled with presumptions this is the entire tactic it took me a [ __ ] year of getting my skull crushed to figure this out this is the basis of everything and when you understand this you completely disarm all attorneys so 90 97% of attorneys this is all they do it's only a very very very small percentage of attorneys that know anything about the law and they know anything about structuring an actual Case by What's called the merits almost

almost nobody I mean I'm dealing with three or four doj attorneys in the Department of Justice right now and and and it's obvious none of them have absolutely any clue how to structure anything involving any sort of like a law uh conversation or argument and you s you didn't see that in the AMX case cuz I was still learning but you're you're seeing it in the SBA case that's really where you're starting to see it's the first time I've ever got anybody on their back foot pretty good um and it's

three attorneys at the doj so I'm I'm feeling like some I'm feeling pretty [ __ ] uh uh I'm I got some pretty big balls walking around this past few days I'll tell you right now because I just want to see if they they they give you a chance to stand in front of them get get some things heard right yeah so if we go back to this thing right so basically you know we've gone over what a contract is we've gone over how that's structured we've gone over the some of the rules associated with

how the lawsuits and stuff go right so now going from there uh I have this whole flowchart I don't know if you want to get into this involving the various structures and and what a person is and all that or if you want to just jump over to financials from here you guys tell me what you want to do well Brandon why are contracts important how do we contract away our rights and I and I think the definition of person in the United States will probably come up in there because people are unknowingly

Contracting away their rights I mean I think so many of your listeners and our listeners realize there's something wrong with the system but they're not exactly sure what and what you opened our eyes to was that we voluntarily give away those rights with how we contract so maybe if you touch on on that a little bit sure so so so basically um this is going to be really really really shocking especially for an audience that's not used to this sort of thing so I will give you guys a little background on how

this all went down right so so um what happened was is you have this thing called the 14th Amendment right so the 14th Amendment if you go to uh uh back to 1871 the 14th Amendment and I will give you uh just one quote from one court case real quick from my website and then we'll go from there I'm going to I'm going to try to show you the actual original uh court cases for a lot of these but this one I'm just going to for sake of time and stuff I'm just going to read it off my website which is

a direct copy and paste from the uh the opinion itself right so this is from Ellen R Van valkenberg versus Albert Brown which is the California Supreme Court right after the 14th amendment was uh quote unquote supposedly ratified which we're going to go over that too that's false uh this is 1872 so the 14th amendment was supposedly ratified in 1871 so one year later maybe even less than one year we don't know maybe six months depending on when these things happened right so this is really

shocking uh almost nobody knows this so you know you may want to uh verify this for yourself which you definitely should no white person born within the limits of the United States and subject to their jurisdiction or born without those limits and subsequently naturalized under their laws owes the status of citizenship to the recent amendments to the Federal Constitution so what so what is he saying there you you you you you're it's so unbelievable that you're you're having trouble even believing

what you just read right and and what you just read is literally exactly what he just said white people have nothing to do with the 14th Amendment yeah and which which may or may not have been ratified right which may or may not well it it wasn't but but the world operates right now as though it does but if you're a white guy it doesn't make a difference either way so the thing is is that uh uh what what class of citizenship was created by the 14th Amendment do you guys know the answer to that question the federal

citizen it's the US citizen category US citizen so they ask you on a driver's license are you a US citizen they ask you for jury duty are you a US citizen they ask you for uh uh voter ID voter ID they're going to ask you are you a US citizen and you know just to just to kind of side note this for a second you know and and I know the Trump Administration is talking about this but but they're in for a real surprise when they start to get into this more and more why is it they never ask you to

really prove citizenship the only people who have ever asked you to prove citizenship and they don't even always do it is the Department of State when they're issuing a passport besides that no no one else and and by the way I know a lot of people who didn't submit any evidence and they got approved it's it's almost kind of completely random if they even check it's almost like a a customs or back check they just randomly pick people to see if if they're if they really are if they've really been proven

as these things right so the thing is is that why is it that no one asks you to prove US citizenship why is it that that they just ask you everybody just asks you even the even on the ds11 form it asks you if you're parents are US citizens and it asks you if your spouse is a US citizen why does everyone ask you this question why why are they not why are they not asking why don't they ask for proof why don't they a document why why is there never anything more than just argue this thing right and the reason why is

because this this thing this US citizen thing is is such a deep crazy rabbit hole that people just don't have any clue what the hell it is right so let's reread this first sentence and um I'm going to go ahead and just replace uh recent amendments with US citizenship and I think it'll it'll really kind of shock you a bit because that's actually what they're saying here no white person born within the limits of the United States and subject to their jurisdiction or born without those limits and

subsequently naturalized under their laws owes the state of US citizenship to anything basically that's what they're saying here right the history and aim of the 14th Amendment is well known yeah back then it was not anymore and the purpose had in view in its adoption well understood yeah back then 6 to 12 months later yeah sure not anymore that purpose was to confer the status of citizenship Upon A numerous class of persons domiciled within the limits of the United States who could not be brought within the

operation of the Naturalization laws because native born and who born though native had at the same time left them without the status of citizenship he's going to explain more about what he's talking about here these persons were not white persons but were in the main persons of African descent who had been held in slavery in this country or if having themselves never been held in slavery were the Native born descendants of slaves prior to the adoption of the 14th Amendment it was settled that neither

slaves nor those who had been such nor the descendants of these though native and Born Free were capable of becoming citizens of the United States and there's a case that a very very well-known case maybe Dread Scott The Dread Scott case that's the one that he he places here right the 13th Amendment though conferring the Boon of Freedom so what does boon mean um just real quick Boon uh a noun that means something that is helpful beneficial or Pleasant especially when it comes at an opportune

time the 13th Amendment though conferring the Boon of Freedom upon native born persons of African blood had left them under an insuperable bar as to citizenship insuperable uh impossible to overcome ins superable uh had left them under an insuperable bar as to citizenship and it was mainly to remedy this condition that the 14th amendment was adopted now in my opinion and I've been trying to figure this out for years this is the best explanation of all of this information in one tiny little pill I mean it doesn't get any

better than than what this particular honorable Judge had to say about the situation there are a lot of other things that I can cover with you there are a lot of other great places we can go the Supreme Court is a great next stop and they say a million different things about this but this is like the the the one punch knockout uh right here in my opinion and can I can I take a shot at summarizing sure sure all right so basically there was a war there were some people pissed off about the war there were some people that they

couldn't put into a category so they created this 14th Amendment thing to take slaves and make them what are called citizenships of the United States which I'm sure you're going to Define in a minute and so that's essentially how they they got around all this stuff as they created the citizens of the United States but they were also to keep able to keep the people happy that were not slaves yeah when you go back in time if you go way way way way way back the first definition of citizen was a white

person you go way if you go to like 1778 and you look up or 1779 you look up the first Naturalization Act the definition of a citizen was literally a white person so so this goes way back this goes way back right so the 13th amendment freed the slaves and they but they had no citizenship so they're basically like they're they're basically what's called stateless if you go on to uh uh stateless Department of state right they have a whole website about this right what is what is statelessness you can go on to the the

US Department of State website uh the Bureau of population refugees and migration they have a whole article on what does it mean to be stateless right and this is actually a a quite an interesting rabbit hole because because actually being stateless has a lot of benefits but but they pretend as though it doesn't and then also uh they don't realize like stateless they're saying saying outside of a of a corporate State there's a lot of states that are not un States there's a lot of states that are

not corporate States they don't ever mention any of that in here ironically enough uh carefully forgetting about all these various States and Nations that may not be integrated into the UN or something like that so it's it's a bit of a biased obviously uh it's a slanted article but it's a very very interesting idea this this idea of statelessness is exactly what we're looking at where the the slaves were released after the 13th amendment was passed everyone was yay you know or what well half the country

was yay and half the country was pissed right and and and it was this whole thing and then um and then the and then after that we have this explosion of okay what do we do with these guys they don't have any citizenship so Brandon for for some context for people who aren't familiar with this at this time white people had State citizenship correct and so this was a a new class but there was no term there was no term for that and and we're going to get into that next this one's so powerful uh this one we're going to

go straight to the actual opinion and then I'm just going to show you that opinion but we're going to um relate it to my notes and then I'll I'll find it live on the show for you because just so it's just so shocking uh and and just so unbelievable that I want to I want to go straight to the source material so this is the source material here right but if we go to if we go to uh my notes on it uh this is from the the big dog this is the actual court case this is the actual court case where

the the federal US citizen category was born so the 14th amendment in itself didn't actually birth the US citizen category it was these Supreme Court cases called The Slaughterhouse Cases and the case number is 83 us36 This opinion of all these people trying to figure out what the hell the 14th Amendment is actually saying especially the first paragraph This opinion is where the US citizen category was actually born okay so so so this is it's kind of complicated it's sort of like did the 14th Amendment create the the US

citizen category it's it's it's it was a later interpretation of the 14th amendment that created the the the the US citizen category but the Supreme Court is in charge of interpreting the 14th Amendment so it's sort of like it's sort of like the the did the 14th Amendment actually create the US citizenship category well according to the people who have the job to interpret it the answer is yes uh so that's basically what happened and then after that if you start looking at a lot

of cases after 1873 they all just point to this case it was sort of like dude we're done we've been talking about this for two years it's over the slaughterous cases uh go go listen to what uh the honorable Judge Miller has to say about this situation uh I just recently looked up a picture of him I thought that was pretty cool uh judge I saw it yeah Freeman Miller Freeman is his middle middle name right yeah it's his middle name right so this is the picture of the judge whose opinion we're about ready to read this

is the judge who was giving the opinion as to the 14th Amendment and what it was talking about Samuel Freeman Miller was an American lawyer and physician and an associate judge of the US Supreme Court from 62 until uh from 1862 until 1890 and uh who authored Landmark decisions in US versus uh kagama which I don't know anything about that case and The Slaughterhouse Cases okay so this is the man who basically interpreted the 14th Amendment or was basically one of the key people who did interpret the 14th

Amendment to believe that it actually split the country into two different citizenship classes and we're going to get into what those are and how that works here in just a moment because people say State citizen just like Nick said a moment ago even that term didn't exist until The Slaughterhouse Cases so you have the birth of these two terms State Citizen and US citizen before that it was just we the people it was just CI no one like in today's world people hear the word citizen or US citizen and it's just

that's it and that's all there is that's not how it's been it hasn't been that way since 1873 but before 1873 it actually really was that way mhm so that's the confusion right so the the first quote uh I'm going to go off these quotes these are the hot hitting quotes and then we're going to find these quotes in the original text the Negro having the Negro having so here's the first quote the the Negro having by the 14th Amendment been declared to be a citizen of the United

States is thus made a voter in every state of the union right so you're starting to see uh the the US citizen category has nothing to do with white people it never did right so so people all these white people are out there oh and guess what by the way all you uh uh uh well-aged Rich gentlemen out there that may be listening to Mark's show only US citizens have a tax liability we're going to get into that in a minute that's gonna be that's going to blow your mind everybody it's awesome

so I've already you you don't realize it yet cuz you may be thinking what the [ __ ] am I supposed to do with all this information uh yeah it's it's the most badass [ __ ] information on the [ __ ] planet people okay you this I've already without even going any F farther if I was you know this building caught on fire and this thing had to end I've already taught you enough to never ever ever legally pay taxes ever again without even have you don't even need to file a [ __ ] 1040 literally but we're

going to keep going deeper and deeper into this obviously because you have to have a really good uh uh a a rounded understanding of all this information to feel comfortably emotionally that's the problem the problem is not I mean if if the emotions weren't a part of this you can go out right now and start getting refunds on all the past three years of all your tax returns get all that money back and and and never [ __ ] file a tax return ever again for as long as you live without without one drop of sweat

it's it's the nervousness the anxiety and the and the self certainty that's missing that's the missing part which is why we have to continue to go down these rabbit holes and it's because we're brainwashed I mean that self-certainty the emotion all that stuff we were taught one way and we were instilled with fear so we don't want to question anything that could possibly threaten our existence because of that fear right that's correct this next uh this next one is the the literal exact section of

the literal exact court case that split the citizenship up citizenship up up into two classes the first section of the 14th article the first section here we go this is it this is this is this is now you got to think before we read this because because this might piss you off pretty good they were trying to solve a real issue the the the whole country was on edge the whole country was freaking out we had just gotten out of a civil war all hell had broken loose we were beaten and battered and and and half the

country still didn't want black people or slaves to have the kind of Rights so they're thinking in their heads well if we give them the same rights as a state citizen or a normal citizen then you know the Civil War is going to start all over again so they're trying to figure out how do we navigate this extremely difficult complicated situation that's that's throughout the entire country and ripping the whole country in half and if we don't figure it out this country is liable to burn itself to the [ __ ]

ground so you just have to take a step back and maybe put yourself back into that time period to understand what I'm about ready to read to you because this is this is it this is the Line This is the section where the entire US citizenship category was literally born y the first section of the 14th Amendment to which our attention is more specially invited opens with a definition of citizenship not only citizenship of the United States but citizenship of the States states no such definition was previously found in the

Constitution nor had any attempt been made to Define it by act of Congress it had been the occasion of much discussion in the courts by the executive departments and in the public journals so we'll stop right there so so it's only been 2 years since the 14th amendment was supposedly ratified and and they're saying Justice Miller Freeman Miller Samuel Freeman Miller is is sitting here he's saying it's only been two years guys and it's been the occasion of much discussion in the

courts and by the executive departments and in the public journals everyone's [ __ ] talking about this thing so you got to think and and it went through lower lower courts it had to it had it it most likely had to go through lower courts to get all the way to the Supreme Court so this is like this is like crazy Buzz everyone's [ __ ] going ballistic for two [ __ ] years everyone's trying to figure it out everybody's [ __ ] talking about it it's everywhere and then like these guys are the guys who

have to figure it out okay so this is him being like okay we've been talking about this everyone's going crazy we got to figure it out right it has been said by imminent judges that no man was a citizen of the United States except as he was a citizen of one of the states composing the union those therefore who had been born Bor and resided always in the district of Colombia ah or in the territories now by the way territories that means areas uh that are basically uh what's called possessions insular possessions

or territories of the United States if we go and look that up real quick uh US territories it's not what you think it is it's areas like American Samoa Guam the northern Mary an Islands Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands so so the and then you start going down this Rabbit Hole a bit more these are these are essentially possessions of the District of Colombia they have nothing to do with the the the states of the union and this is the terminology he's using the Justice Miller you you people people think

Justice Miller [ __ ] up the whole country no actually did a great job describing the difference between these two different zones it's just no one took the time to understand what Justice Miller had to say and then here we are 150 years later and we're all [ __ ] okay so so let's reread this those therefore who had been born and resided always in the district of Colombia or in areas such as American Samoa Guam the Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico the US Virgin Islands Etc ra though within

the United States were not citizens whether this proposition was sound or had or or not had ever been judicially decided but it had been held by this court in the celebrated Dread Scott Case Case only a few years before the outbreak of the Civil War that a man of African descent whether a slave or not was not not and could not be a citizen of a state or the United States this is what they're trying to figure out this is what Justice Miller is trying to figure out and his boys right this decision while it meant the

condemnation of some of the ablest Statesmen and constitutional lawyers of the country had never been overruled and if it was to be accepted as a constitutional limitation of the right of citizenship then all the Negro race who had recently been made free men by the 13th Amendment were still not only not citizens but were incapable of becoming so by anything short of an amendment to the Constitution this paragraph is everything yeah this paragraph is all taxation this paragraph is massive for your financial success this paragraph

difference this paragraph is the difference between you having the right to bear arms which is the second amendment or having to get a a firearms license the Second Amendment people argue with me about this and I start screaming I say where Second Amendment where in the Second Amendment does it say anything about Firearms doesn't it doesn't Firearms has nothing to do with the Second Amendment and the second amendment has nothing to do with firearms firearms are held by slaves slaves are called US

citizens slaves are essentially property of the federal government if you are telling them that you are their property you don't have the Second Amendment only state citizens have the Second Amendment it's been that way since Judge Miller on the exact date I'll give you the exact date of when this became activated the exact date April 14th by Justice M Mr Justice Miller since April 14th of of 1873 if you say you are a US citizen you do not have the right to bear arms so Brandon I I think about it this

way and I may have gotten this from you my my first job out of college was at craft foods and when I became an employee at craft Foods I was basically saying when I go to work I'm willing to give up my constitutional rights to follow their rules right I'm not going to bring Firearms I'm not going to do certain things that I have constitutional rights to so when someone becomes a US citizen it's almost like they're becoming an employee of the federal government and they're giving up

their rights in the meantime they're Contracting or voluntarily giving up those rights to be that employee or property of the federal government that's correct that's correct so um let's see here the first observ ation the first obser okay so getting into this a little bit more this is the case where all this happened so I like the van valkenberg case because because I feel like it's a nice little quick package but if you want if you want the true big dog and you want everything laid out word for

word and you want the exact exact details of everything that's what we're getting into here in this case still with the Slaughterhouse Cases and Justice Miller okay so the first observation we have to make on on this Clause meaning the the first Clause all he literally gives the Clause right here above that all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside right so so so right now with the Trump Administration

you've got all this talk right now about uh Birthright citizenship and how it relates to 14th Amendment it's all completely irrelevant all that conversation is completely irrelevant because the thing is that no one everyone has forgotten the purpose of all this and why was made it was made because the 13th Amendment released the slaves and they had no freaking citizenship they couldn't do anything so it was like it was like pointless to release them and that was what was the 14th amendment was to remedy that

problem okay so the first observation we have to make on this Clause is that it puts at rest both the questions which we stated to have been the subject of differences of opinion it declares that persons may be citizens of the United States without regard to their citizenship of a particular State and it overturns the Dread Scott decision by making all persons born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the United States now keep in mind he already said earlier that the definition of United

States is the District of Colombia and the US Territory she didn't say anything about States so if you're in California or Utah or Texas or Indiana or New York or or I can keep going that has nothing to do with what they're talking about here and you can see that very very clearly in 4 USC 71 4 USC 71 permanent seat of government all that part of the territory of the United States included within the present limits of the District of Colombia shall be the permanent seat of government of the United States and you

can also see that in UCC 9307 subsection h says it in black and white location of United States the United States is located in the district of Colombia So when you say you are a US citizen you are saying that you are a citizen of the District of Colombia or one of the US territories or insular possessions such as American Samoa Guam the US Virgin Islands Puerto Rico Etc someone who lives in Puerto Rico and was born in Puerto Rico would be a US citizen that's what he's saying here he's saying persons born within the

United States and subject to its jurisdiction is State of California within the exclusive jurisdiction of the national government fre Google tells you no y for USC 71 all that part of the territory of the United States included within the present limits of the District of Columbia shall be the permanent seat of government of the United States they aren't talking about the 50 Union states nope United States has nothing to do with California at all you can see that again in um kaha versus us I actually just used this in the SBA

case and I just slaughtered those doj attorneys with this one oh my God so the United States is a fictional entity that was created around this time to F solve a problem for the slaves and they created this thing really we think it's 50 states and all together but it's really this little spot in the district of Colombia and the insul possessions well the thing is the United States the thing makes it a bit interesting too is that the the the the the the 48 states of the Union it's actually not 50 Hawaii

and Alaska I think are actually on the United States side I think uh they're actually uh possessions or territories of the United States I I'm still a little bit iffy on those two but the other 48 I'm 100% positive on so let's say let's say California for example right so California is an entirely Sovereign Nation from the nation called United States yeah so and I just smashed these doj attorneys on this and they were so blown away I had this doj attorney on the phone for meet and

confer and I was telling him all this stuff and he was just he didn't even know what to he was just so shocked he didn't even know what to say it was absolutely hilarious and then they they actually filed into the case yesterday and they they they defended against a US Supreme Court decision and the actual definition of a state court from the actual statute they were trying to use on me uh uh the the defense toward was oh on the Los Angeles website they defined Los Angeles as part of a state

which is in in the United States I'm just like oh man come on it's like three or four doj attorneys working on this case bro absolutely [ __ ] it's the first time I've ever been it's kind of sad to say it's the first time I've ever been in a really good position in a case which is sad but uh you know I I I never went to law school I never did any of the [ __ ] I'm just like just straight out the [ __ ] gate started filing lawsuits and I'm just kind of learning as I go

and I'm a year into it and now I'm cooking [ __ ] DOD attorneys for breakfast to me that's pretty [ __ ] good but it it has taken a long time and a lot of work to to to to learn this stuff and to get to get this stuff put together okay so maybe maybe it's good that you didn't go to law school You' have been Tau the wrong way just like people are taught about money the wrong way oh yeah I mean school is just crap I mean that's why you know I agree with Trump uh the Trump Administration right

now taking down the Department of Education I agree wholeheartedly I think we need some massive reform oh by the way uh uh when it comes to public education uh in 1871 the same year that the 14th amendment was passed we have the organic Act of 1871 this was the birth of the District of Colombia it's literally called the District of Colombia organic Act of 1871 guess what the cookie or benefit of the District of Columbia organic Act of 1871 was to try to get people to go along with it I don't know you it was the public

education system wow so so the same time period that the US citizenship category was born that same year was when the public school system was born through the District of Columbia organic Act of 1871 and it also obviously birthed the District of Columbia as well so Brandon quick quick question on States so we're talking about the state of California is that not a franchise of the District of Columbia I know there's like there's California which is the land and the state and then there's

State of California which corporation which is my understanding is a franchise or of that Federal Corporation am I thinking about that correctly did this come about later on yeah so let me finish this thought first and then I'll I'll get into that one right so kaha V us this is the one I just used in a case just now with the doj attorneys and just um you know you never know they've got they've got tools I don't have they've got you know I don't even use West law and stuff there's a lot of really crazy

tools that are out there that are really expensive that I don't use necessarily so I'm over here thinking like you know maybe I'm missing something right no I didn't miss nothing this is this is still 100% active uh because if it if it if it wasn't active they would plug it into Westlaw and they would have they would have uh filed a response in opposition and they would have said like why it's been overturned or whatever they didn't do that they try to use a definition from website which is the

most hilarious thing in the world and it shows that I've really got them on the [ __ ] ropes of this one right this statute is one of universal application within the territory limits of the United States and is not limited to Those portions which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the national government such as the District of Colombia generally speaking within any state of this Union the preservation of the peace and the protection of person and property are the functions of the state government and are no part of the

primary duty at least of the Nation meaning the federal government the laws of Congress in respect to those matters do not extend end into the territorial limits of the states but only have force uh but have Force only in the district of Colombia and other places that are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the national government that's huge yeah so so so when when I when I sued the SBA in State Court they used this 28 USC 1442 to remove that case to federal court right uh a civil action or criminal

prosecution that is commenced the state court and that is against or directed to any of the following may be removed by them to the district court which means federal court of the United States right and it says here if you're suing the United States any agency thereof or any officer right but if you go down it's state court definition of state court and this is where I I just blew the hair off these doj attorneys right the term State Court includes the superior court of the District of Columbia a court of a

United States territory or insular possession and a tribal court amazing state state of California has nothing to do with these definitions and thus State of California wouldn't be classified as a state court so thus 28 uh USC 1442 because the original case started in state of California it's they can't do it it's fraudulent so it's it's a beautiful it's a beautiful thing to know when you start to understand these two different exclusive jurisdictions right so there's

actually 49 jurisdictions in in America there's there's the 48 individual states that that doesn't include Hawaii and Alaska and then and then the 49th jurisdiction is a completely different jurisdiction which is the District of Colombia and then you think to yourself oh well what about Guam Puerto Rico no those are actually possessions possessions those are those are not sovereign states they are literally like owned property like if someone bought an island with cash yeah so so so the

District of Columbia is a country it is a Sovereign Nation it is a state they they there's a whole website uh make uh Washington DC the 51st state they've been trying to do this forever and this is just this is just done I assume just to try to confuse people state of Washington DC 51st state they've been trying to do this forever paths to statehood it it's it it this this whole website these people have no clue but the thing is you start reading the FAQ and they totally know they

totally know because look at this one this one this one really blew really blew my hair out of my head if DC becomes the 51st state what will happen to the federal seat of government monuments and museums the federal seat of government where did we see that before 4 USC 71 all that part of the territory of the United States included within the present limits of the of the District of Columbia shall be the permanent seat of government of the United States so they're they're saying if DC becomes a state what happens to

United States and this first few words just really really creep me out this area is unpopulated Yep this area is unpopulated will be clearly mapped and will remain in place under Federal jurisdiction as the District of Columbia wow doesn't even make sense Wild so so so this is just goofiness I don't know what I don't know what they're trying to do I don't know I don't know why they're doing this I don't know what they're trying to pull or maybe they're just confused I don't know who knows but

the thing is is that United States and California are two entirely different countries Brandon quick question here what exactly is the United States of America and is Donald Trump the president of the United States or of the United States of America Donald Trump is the president of the United States so the areas in which Donald Trump is the president of includes Guam Puerto Rico the US Virgin Islands American Samoa District of Colombia so it's the District of Colombia and all of its possessions if you want it if you want

the easiest and fastest way of saying that right yeah now at this point we can get into the franchise right so so we have how many constitutions perfect segue are there for State of California right yeah the answer is two right so so so a constitution by definition you only have one Constitution for one state when you start going down that rabbit hole that's how it works so what that means is there's two versions of California okay the first version came when when the state was first introduced into the

Union which you can go down that rabbit hole it's pretty cool cuz I'm I'm here so I went down that rabbit hole pretty good 1849 I couldn't find the original Constitution anywhere uh online all I could find was uh uh pictures of the original handwritten parchment version uh on the uh uh State of California you know website the main main main website right which doesn't help me because I can't read the goddamn thing it's in you know old parchment uh cursive and I started trying to read it and it was

just really really difficult so what did I do I went down to the the local law library and the very very helpful uh Librarians uh helped me to find a a printed text version uh and I decided to go ahead and upload it to my website because you can't really find it anywhere else uh I looked all over the internet I couldn't find it anywhere so um if we go to [Music] California um let's see here give me just a second we'll find this while you're looking I I highly recommend everyone to go through all of

Brandon's websites i' I printed off everything and read it and highlighted and it's a wealth of mindblowing information and I know Mark's been through it as well so highly recommend visiting those yeah thank you so so this is my personal copy that I scanned and uploaded to my website this is the original constitution of of 1849 you can't find it online so uh it's a great it's a great find uh I did read the whole thing I do have it on my counter over here people talk about the US

Constitution the Constitution the Constitution the Constitution and people don't realize your state constitution is very powerful very very I would depending on the circumstances I'd go so far as to say when it comes to your own rights and your own ability to operate I'd say your state constitution is actually even more more important but most people don't even know which one to look at so it it just the amount of confusion is just what it is but all you got to do to figure this out it's very

simple all you got to do is just uh where did we go here we were uh missing my where did we go here this is here we go so the the the the this is obvious because you have the 14th amendment was 1871 so what did they do they just created a second version after the 14th Amendment right so what is that what is that second area right so so if we go I'm not sure about all this this is kind of a new rabbit hole for me uh when was the capital building in California gifted to the federal government let's see let's

see what this says um 1931 so that wouldn't that wouldn't match right California state cap Capital let's see what do we got you're just kind of seeing kind of how I do this right um so okay interesting here we go here's here's a good conect Connecting Point so the the structure was completed between 1860 and 1874 um and then and then boom right after 1874 we have the creation of an entirely new constitution right so so what it is is basically there two State there's two californias there's

California and then there's State of California right so so so so State of California is referring to this land located within Sacramento California like for example if you go onto my website I have a link to the DN the the dun and Brad street for State of California it's literally in the DNB business directory it's a [ __ ] business yep where's the address of this business state capital Sacramento California 95814 United States so what does that mean so what you would do is you would you would go

online and you would do a a a land pull you'd go on like the um the uh the the the uh BLM Glo lookup I don't know if you'd look here actually you probably wouldn't look here this is the uh the land patent records this is really cool actually you can go AAL AAL title right yeah you can go in here and uh you let's say you want to look up your own property uh there there's a presidential decree called a land patent uh and if you go let's say we go to Clay County in Alabama search

patents and you find your property and you click this little you click this image over here uh for no cost and in 5 minutes you can get yourself a PDF copy of the original presidential land patent and then what you do is there's a process that you can you can do to take this and and actually make it active currently and and get rid of all the quick claim deeds and everything that are currently on the property and this is how you can actually patent your own property and become a a property tax exempt because

you think to yourself oh US citizen that's for that's for property tax too right now it's a different process for that you would get these original this is the or Orin and you can go down you can see it's handwritten and you can go all the way down to the bottom and you can see here uh it was signed by the president of the United States which at that time was Martin Van Bean it looks like I don't never heard that name before van Bean which president was he um I don't know 12th or something the eth president

of the United States serving from 18 1837 to 1841 so this is a Alabama is a this is a really really old land patent right and if you want to order certified copies of this to use uh legally you just click here and I think it's like a few dollars to get certified copies mailed to your home right does this process take it take your property out of the United States yes okay this is your property will become essentially its own Nation at that point you wouldn't have um uh property taxes you wouldn't have if

anyone goes on your property you can legally murder them I'm actually not kidding you could actually shoot them in the head now if you shot at them and they weren't standing on your meats and Bounds of your property line that would be an international Act of terrorism if they step one foot onto your property and you shoot him in the head with a shotgun and their explodes to the movies there'd be there'd be no legal repercussions at all whatsoever question Brandon what what happens if a

property since 18 whatever 20 um has been cut up and now you you live on a piece of property that's a fraction of the size of this original one that was signed by the president or whatever how do how does that work do you have that that gets pretty hairy you can actually you can actually take the land patent and you can actually forcibly legally take over your neighbor's properties wow so it goes deeper it go it gets pretty it gets pretty crazy real fast but go ahead and try that and and

you're someone's going to kill you while you're sleeping so that's that's a natural that's that that's that's the beauty of common law we don't need all this crazy statute and everything common law is go ahead go ahead and file that land patent and steal your neighbor's property and we'll see what happens you know what I mean I don't think you'll be long for this world okay I don't think the courts need to get involved in that one so so so going back to this we're starting to

to piece these things together this is circumstantial evidence obviously right but we have this thing 18 uh 74 right and then we saw that that so what I would do is is pull the and I haven't done this yet I should do this pull the actual meets and Bounds of the property located at this this property what so so this green area maybe that's the property line maybe it's not I want the legal property line this let's say for example this green area is the legal property line for the the state capital

if that's the case this is the location of the nation called State of California and then California would be everything else that we think of as California the problem is when you sign up for voter registration you're not saying that you live in California you're saying that you live in state of California which is this zone so basically C California is 99 more than 99% of everyone who is supposedly lives in California legally they live in this little square or and this is where contracts come in because you contract

into the state of California you you told them yeah so so if we start getting into that uh that that comes from 8 USC 1101 subsection a23 this is this is how how do you get someplace cuz you got to think the definition of the word person which shockingly we haven't even got into yet uh maybe we should uh get into that for just a moment because you have to understand the the definition of the word person in order to understand all of this craziness it's all craziness right people are sitting here watching

this being like this is all horseshit right it is horseshit and and if more people knew about it people would be doing something about it and that's why I teach I don't teach I don't teach all this because I want it to be this way I teach all this because I know that when the average American learns all this [ __ ] they're going to be [ __ ] pissed and we got a lot of pissed off Americans this [ __ ] ain't going to [ __ ] last much longer brother that's that's the I'm working myself out of a job that's

what I do right so what's the definition of the word person the term person shall be construed to mean and include an individual a trust estate partnership Association company or Corporation right so the word person includes fictional legal entity so you got to think to yourself all of the law has to cater to the fact that persons are also fictional madeup things so so so they had to create this fictional madeup State of California right and and the thing is it's it's like a business how how can

you you say to yourself oh I H my business is in California okay that's only because you have a physical location but what if you're an e-commerce company think about that yeah you got to think e-commerce companies I I work from Williams and Williams Law Firm doesn't have a doesn't have a physical location I don't have an office so so when I say Williams and Williams law firms in California which I don't say by the way how how can anyone prove that how can anyone prove or

disprove that it's a physical impossibility as we've moved more and more into this digital age it's become more and more impossible to say that a business is in a particular location it's not right a business is just an idea but what people don't realize is it's been this way for uh uh well over a hundred years way before the people think like oh this must have changed after the internet because uh now we have all these digital companies that don't have a physical location and they

wanted to make it to no this this it's been this way forever it's been this way forever it's been this way for ages and the reason why is because the definition of the word person includes these things that don't have a location in the physical world so we go to uh a naturalization and we learn how does a person get located and it's one of the most mindblowing things I've ever found in my entire life and it makes a lot of sense to a lot of things that are really confusing the term naturalization

means the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth by any means whatsoever so what does that mean you or or or any of your businesses or any of your trusts or anything are simply wherever you say they are yep that is how things are located so when you say you are a resident which the definition of Resident means somebody who's in an area temporarily for some sort of business or recreational purpose it's actually not even your permanent location where you would actually live the word domicile is

the legal term so you say you're a resident which often can be construed legally to mean employee when you go into work you're a resident of where you work because you go home at the end of the day or at the end of the week to your doile doile yeah so if I say I'm a resident of State of California that means I I I'm temporarily here for some sort of business or recreational purpose and then State of California means this place which I think I closed the window out already I know here it is

this place and because you work for the government when you say you're a resident of State of California that's why you have to pay state taxes Brandon you you really opened my eyes to this because what I did and what I think most entrepreneurs and most people do is they set up an LLC in state of California cor what they're doing is creating a person correct that they're naturalizing into California so they voluntarily contract to pay state income tax is when what what I'm doing now and

what what they could do as well is set up a person a trust an entity that is forign to the United States therefore doesn't earn income in the United States therefore doesn't even have to file taxes that is absolutely correct y mind blown because because you aren't the one getting that money it's that person that's getting that money and and depending on where you put that it's like a pling piece piece that you could put anywhere they' any time they've trick at any time they've tricked you to

creating these specific types of pieces and always placing those particular pieces in these particular locations right so so so so the thing is is that another thing that that's really shocking to people is the the term US citizen so so so so if if if if persons include legal fictions and legal fictions have a national ity that means that legal fictions can be US citizens and that was really shocking too we have the definition of a US citizen all the way down here at uh 42 USC 9102 subsection 18 and we go into subsection

C this is pretty shocking for people too any Corporation partnership Association or other entity organized or existing under the laws of the United States or of any state and by the way they they write that on purpose to be really tricky they make you think that when you see the word state that means the 58 the the 48 states of the Union if you look the word state is capitalized and it's not the beginning of a sentence they capitalize the word and it's a special definition that's referring to one of

the US territories or insular possessions amazing if you click on state it means each of the several States the District of Columbia the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico American Samoa the United States Virgin Islands Guam the Commonwealth of the northern mariiana islands and any other Commonwealth territory or possession over which the United States has jurisdiction and you see to yourself well hold on a second Brandon this is confusing because they're trying to make Washington DC the 51st state so how the

[ __ ] can District of Colombia be a state when they have a [ __ ] whole website that says that it's not a state and the reason why is because they aren't talking about the 48 states of the Union at all they're talking only and exclusively about the United States which is the District of Colombia and its US territories and insular possessions and then they use the word includes they use the word it means each of the several States this is another thing so the term several States was

used very very often back in the day when the in the early part of our nation to refer to the actual States all of the little ones Vermont Massachusetts all those so if you go way back to that time period they use this term several States but they don't capitalize the word s yeah all they did was they capitalized the word s they use that same terminology to fool people they aren't talking about any of the states of the Union because because it says here any territory possession over which the

United States has jurisdiction they don't have any jurisdiction over the 48 states of the Union which has already been covered in kaha versus us which is a case from like 1891 it's never been overturned this is the world we live in so when you're reading this stuff right it's absolutely crazy because what they're saying here is any Corporation partnership Association or other entity organized or existing under the laws of the UN United States or any US Territory or insular possession which has as its president or

other executive officer or as its chairman of the board of directors or holder or similar office and an individual who is a a c United States citizen and who has more no more than blah blah blah so if you say you are a US citizen and you have a a corporation trust Association or other entity and you are a uh a chairman or holder or or whatever then that business itself is a United States citizen as it's as a person it there's two United States citizens there's you as a United States

citizen and there's so what does this mean in English if you say you're a US citizen all your businesses are actually the District of Columbia's businesses so how does the IRS get into your bank account whatever they want because you didn't pay a bill because it's not your business it's their business that's why you have to report taxes that's why you have to have a withholding officer and they come in and they'll bust you if you don't because you told them you're a US citizen so

that means your business the the business that you think is yours is not yours it's theirs so Brandon is this is this a good point to uh segue into the all caps name as an as a US citizen [Music] entity yeah so so so if we go back to um the the breakdown of all the stuff we close out some of these windows here and we go back to um the the flowchart that I've made right we have um we have this thing that basically was created right called the sole proprietorship right so so so what is a soul proprietorship we can go

straight to um we can go straight to the IRS website to to learn about what that is right so so assault proprietor is somebody who owns an unincorporated business by themselves now what they say is they say that if you use your name and you don't have anything attached to it like Brandon Joe Williams painting wouldn't necessarily be a self- proprietorship right but but when you when you do business with just by using your name just by itself they consider that to be a sole propri proprietorship then you look up the

definition of a self proprietorship it's an unincorporated business so you got to ask yourself and no one's ever asked this question bro I've never seen in any court case ever I've studied a lot of court cases about s proprietorships where in the flying [ __ ] did this business come from your name is a business they're telling you right here it's a business where in the [ __ ] did this business come from it's unincorporated I never opened a business of myself in all capital

letters who who opened it where did it come from who filled out the paperwork even in their definition they show that it's two entities it's it's you and and a business entity so it's two different persons you're considered the owner of the S proprietorship you start looking into CA case law on this and court cases they say owner and self proprietor sh it's two different persons okay but again uh uh if if anyone sues me in my name we're going to go straight to Discovery and the first question I'm

going to break the table in half pounding it so [ __ ] hard where the [ __ ] did this thing come from yeah great question it's a presumption too so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna throw that presumption across the table you need to prove where in the [ __ ] did this thing come from Good Luck you're never going to if you start digging into that people are going to stop you from digging into that and if you dig into that and try putting it on a docket someone's going to stop that docket item from going into

that court case so you ask that question the court case goes bye-bye instantaneously where did this thing come from my personal Theory my personal theory on this my personal theory on this is is is circumstantial but we have this is the Articles of Incorporation the the birth certificate because it's a person birth certificate of a corporation yes the Articles of Incorporation are considered the birth certificate of a corporation okay so what if we reverse engineered the same question is my birth

certificate a Articles of Incorporation for a business no you conspiracy theorist right okay okay fine I I think it is I think think it is because this thing came from somewhere so so where did it come from if if if an article of incorporation is the birth certificate for a business you just re you just reverse engineer that same question and you get the answer to the question where the [ __ ] did this thing come from that that to me this is the answer the birth certificate is In Articles of Incorporation for assault

proprietorship so the state the United States sets up a corporation a sole proprietorship with the same name as you when you're born and they presume that you will act as that and so here's the functional question is how do we separate how do I separate myself from this all caps entity that is a US citizen easiest thing in the world it's just a business same same thing as as if you were confused and thought you were Starbucks if we go to the ss4 form this is the form to get an uh employer

identification number if we go to the ss4 form it tells us something very very shocking type of entity sole proprietor guess what the tax identification number is for the person of which is the sole proprietorship your social security number your social security number so what is the Social Security number yes it's an account it it it it literally the old old old cards if you go to um uh 1936 social security card uh this is pretty shocking if you look at the old this is the very very very first version they were very quick

to change these by the way I asked too many questions uh it says account number and then employees signature y wow wow they they they they they swapped these real [ __ ] fast this was the very very very first version of these and there isn't there a QP number on the back yeah that's that I have circumstantial evidence for a lot of that kind of stuff I'm not going to get into all that because I don't I'm trying to just stay within the Realms of what's what's what's kind of more you

know I've been in litigation for a while so I kind of think that way these days right so so so so what what are they saying they're saying that there's an account number here and they're saying that it has something to do with an employee and then over here we connect this information it's the it's the it's the it's the um the the tax identification number for this other person and then and then we type in like uh a social security card um if you look at pictures of the

of all the newer ones it says right on the back uh you don't own this it's not yours you ever seen that if you look on the back of your Social Security card let me see if I can find a I just ordered a new one that would make sense because you're the you're the agent for that entity you don't own it yeah uh let me see if I can zoom in here we go so this is the terminology and then this is that Bond number you were talking about um which I've gone down that rabbit hole I haven't really successfully done a whole

lot with it but this is from 1988 um this card is the property of the Social Security Administration and must be returned upon request so so you got to think it it has something to do with a person that person is a business we've already proved that that that business came from somewhere we we can't figure out where but Brandon has a theory as to where it may have come from that that we've proven without Beyond A Reasonable Doubt the tax identification number of that businessperson is the social security

number that makes sense I didn't make the damn thing I don't know where the goddamn thing came from so I don't own it and we see that here so so we're starting to piece this together right you have a business you have a business and you got to think you got to think you know uh uh if you go back to uh title 8 8 USC 11101 uh uh it gets it gets crazy because we start looking at the definition of the word person right from title 8 and this is all about getting passports and stuff like that too right uh if we go down to

the definition I think it's B6 or something uh we're going to find it here I'm going to click on this B3 a1101 subsection B3 the term person means an individual or an organization so wait a second Brandon are you telling me an organization can get a passport definitely in fact that your passport that you have is for an organization called a so proprietorship that's why they ask for the social security number on the ds11 form you are the agent on behalf of a sole proprietorship the sole proprietorship

is what has things like passports and driver's licenses people say driver's licenses are unconstitutional they are that's why you don't have it they they got around the Constitution by creating a so proprietorship that's how they got around the Constitution driver's licenses are completely constitutional because they aren't given to men or women of the Union as described by free man Samuel Miller in The Slaughterhouse Cases of of 1873 they're given to these businesses

which are US citizens there's nothing unconstitutional about that at all whatsoever taxation is unconstitutional no it's not not one bit you aren't the one pay paying any tax they aren't directly taxing you that would be illegal and unconstitutional they are taxing a self- proprietorship and hoping that you'll behave as though you are it which most people do this is so important and Brandon so many people like I've I've gotten so confused in this process because people complicate

what this entity is and they try to to claim it or get rid of it and really when you realize it's a sole proprietorship that you can sign as the agent for when you want to and not when you don't want to then you can sign it and really limit your liability by endorsing it in the way that you talk about right Endor anything any contracts you've got a business you've got a business it's that simple you've got a business and and and the self proprietorship is a very unique type of

business the owner and the self proprietorship are considered kind of like the same person in law you can look up tax cases where where the IRS or whatever is suing a s proprietorship and and the owner of the S proprietorship takes the Fifth Amendment and he says that he didn't have to he didn't have to disclose uh tax information to the IRS because he has a Fifth Amendment right through the sole proprietorship and the the the courts actually found that to be correct so there's actually some pretty

crazy case law behind this so so you can actually operate pretty much as though you are the sole proprietorship and the courts will allow that but on the on the flip side you also have to make sure that that it's very clear that you're there's two separate person there otherwise uh uh if you say you are the S proprietorship which is what people do and you never make that distinction then they they they can say they're picking up the S proprietorship and putting it in a jail cell uh and it's you because

you don't have any rights as a s proprietorship so proprietorship is a US citizen it's a released black negro slave after the Civil War that was released from involuntary servitude but could not attain citizenship that is essentially how the s proprietorships class if the so the sole proprietorship is a person that person you could imagine a picture of that person as a black man who has broken chains and is just like looking around like really lost as to what's going on and where he

is that's what the soul proprietorship is so Brandon quick question for you then you've got the soul proprietorship or all caps name or what we call ends leges all kind of the same thing which is not you it's your entity that's a bus business and then you've got you your flesh and blood can you have both of those at the same time can you operate having you know Social Security benefits uh US citizen benefits under the district Colombia and then also satisfy uh this whole other side where you are a

a a a non-resident alien can you do both at the same time yeah you have two persons you have two persons right so you you are the one who determines which one is the one who has the bank accounts you know which one is the one that is collecting what you would consider income which that's a hilarious term income income doesn't really exist that's a whole another conversation but uh the the the the the whole idea here we let's look at the definition of the word organization from title 8 this is

involving uh nationality right this is interesting because it it it this this completes the circle as to uh all of this information because most of the time when you look at the word person it's very specific you know a corporation a trust a partnership a company right it's all Incorporated elements but but the the definition of the word person in title 8 uh uh uh includes organizations organization means but is not limited to an organization Corporation company partnership Association trust Foundation

or fund and include includes a group of persons look at this this is this is the big dog right here whether or not Incorporated let's go back to that definition of a s proprietor from the IRS website a s proprietor is somebody who owns an unincorporated business by themselves so this gets even crazier because the the definition of the term soulle proprietorship by itself because it's unincorporated you could say it's not actually a person in the tax code I wouldn't do that but you could do that

right but title 8 nationality is very very careful to make sure that they specifically allow unincorporated organizations which to me is kind of an oxymoron I think if you were to bring any of this up I don't even think the courts even know how to have this I don't think this argument's ever been brought since 1776 personally I've never seen it uh so the thing is you got to realize that they're specifically saying that unincorporated businesses even are considered per sons and that makes even

more sense for the passport because what is a passport issued to an individual or an organization and you say to yourself oh Brandon an individual means a man or a woman right no it doesn't an individual is a shortening for individual proprietorship which used to be a term and then and then that term became s proprietor the term individual and the term s proprietorship mean the same thing H so if you reread the definition of the word person an individual or an organization the actual definition in

English is a soul proprietorship or an organization that's why you never see your name spelled any other way except on capital letters on everything that's right the word and and the reason why the word person cannot possibly include you as a man or a woman is because all this stuff is all unconstitutional duh they can't do it so their solution was create create a business with the name and then we're going to attach all the stuff to the business and now it's not unconstitutional anymore and they're

exactly 100% correct and and you can see that in um uh what was I going to show you uh the term organization unconstitutional business oh jeez I just lost my train of thought but um the the um this is how this all works this all works is is you were given a business the business has the same name as you um you've been confused uh and and then you wonder where your rights went and you went you you identified with this business and then and then the business does not have the rights of a man or a woman so uh

that that is basically the Simplicity of of what occurred oh oh I know I was going the Commerce Clause so all this comes down to the Commerce Clause the Commerce Clause is basically the Rome of 2025 right the Commerce Clause uh uh gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations uh among the states and with Indian tribes right so plary power is the term used to describe where does Congress have power over complete power over a particular area with no limitations this term is often used to describe the

commerce power of congress under the Commerce Clause Congress has granted full power over Interstate Commerce the court has found that states are not able to pass laws affecting interstate commerce without the permission of of Congress so basically what happened was Congress only has exclusive jurisdiction in the district of Colombia and in the US territories and stuff but they can also reach out to the states as long as there's some kind of interstate commerce occurring that's why they they decided

to create a business because the business now opens the door for Commerce and Commercial activity and then bam now they can grab jurisdiction over it right same thing with the word uh uh motor vehicle the word motor vehicle actually means a vehicle uh uh that that's actually uh uh uh currently involved in transporting persons or property or cargo for some sort of fee rate charge or other consideration for example if we go to the word driver in 49cfr 39.5 T we're going to look up the word driver you

have a driver's license the definition of the word driver is any person which that should already be setting off bells in your head because that definition does include companies corporations trust organizations who operates any commercial motor vehicle so a driver's license is a license to do interstate commerce now that you've told them you're involved in interstate commerce now now now Congress which normally would only have an exclusive jurisdiction over the United States which means the District of Columbia and

its US territories and insular possessions you told them you're involved in interstate commerce that's how the District of Colombia got jurisdiction over your ability to transport yourself in what's called a motor vehicle or if it's not a motor vehicle it's called an automobile and this is still true even to today State of California definitions of automobile and I swear to God they're going to take down this website one day because of all my [ __ ] I bring this up all the

time so you go right to the state of California website you can see with your own eyes this is not Freeman ofthe land.net okay this is the the state of California DMV website automobile is a passenger vehicle that does not transport persons for hire a commercial vehicle is a vehicle which is used or maintained for the transportation of persons For Hire compensation or profit or designed used or maintained primarily for the transportation of property for example trucks and Pickups it's two entirely different classes if you have

an automobile and you take that automobile to the DMV to register that automobile it converts the automobile to a motor vehicle it wasn't a motor vehicle until you converted it so that kind you guys get are you guys getting this I'm talking to the audience now because what Brandon is showing you and he's showing you in a very methodical way is that everything that you think you know is not so and you have to look underneath and and it takes guys like Brandon Williams to go underneath and say hey what's the story

behind with the story because we've been taught a story and it's surrounded by fear we think we need a driver's license are we operating in Commerce no so we don't need a dri driver's license but we submit we submit ourselves to having to be licensed to do this having to pay taxes which I want to go to soon and and even and even even if you are transporting persons or property for some sort of fee rate charge or any other consideration in order for congress which means the whole

government really to have any jurisdiction over that and in order for that to be classified as a motor vehicle it has to be interstate commerce what does that mean you have to cross state lines yes if you're in California and you're a a chauffeur and you're ubering and you're ubering within the territorial boundaries of Los Angeles you don't need a driver's license that's interesting if you if you transport if you take an Uber Rider from LA to Las Vegas you need a driver's

license wow so if I was driving for Uber uh uh they'll never allow this in a million years I would totally just I would do all this with Uber just to have an opportunity to sue them because I'll win and make a bunch of money because they're idiots but if I was an Uber driver and I didn't have a driver's license and it popped up and it said hey this guy wants to go let's say I lived on the border somewhere uh of of Arizona and it was like a lot of the people that wanted to get rides from me in Uber uh

because it's you know just a few miles down the road to go to Arizona they're going back and forth from what would be considered Arizona and and and and California whatever I would just never take those people because if I were to take that that that person over that state line it would be legally interstate commerce at that point it would fall under the Commerce Clause at that point it would fall under Congress and Congress can can tell you if you can have if you have to have a driver's

license in order to drive so at that point you would be within the jurisdiction of them telling you that so as long as you don't transport persons or property for some sort of fee rate charge or other consideration over state lines you don't need a driver's license now if you're in the district of Colombia or Guam or Puerto Rico or American Samoa you would need a driver's license yep so that's a good setup it's a good model that we submit ourselves to something for a driver's license what

about taxes are we submitting ourselves to pay taxes because we submit ourselves to the IRS or the District of Columbia which we think is our definition of the United States of course uh W9 Form everybody fills one of these out under penalties of perjury I certify that point number three I am a US citizen or or other us person there it is defined below defined below signature of us person now I want to I want to really blow up some heads here uh uh I've had some people try to give me w9s and I

laugh really really hard in their face because if I sign a W9 this is what's going to happen 18 USC 911 whoever falsely and willfully represents himself to be a citizen of the United States shall be fined under this title or impr prison not more than 3 years or both so if anybody places one of these in front of me I always ask them I go are you trying to get me to go to prison for up to three years what are you trying to do and they look at me like I'm crazy and I show them 18 USC 91 I said I'm not a US

citizen or other us person if you think I'm going to sign this and put myself up to three years in prison you you crazy you're absolutely [ __ ] nuts so so if we go down to to us person it says here uh certification I am a US citizen or other us person defined below okay defined below so let's take a look and see if we can find this this elusive definition of us person um I haven't looked down here in a long time oh self proprietor right here look at that enter enter your individual name as

shown right so the word individual means s proprietor I didn't get into that you'll see like for example the word um person in the tax code is an individual an estate a partnership an association right people think the word individual means them which I did for a long time too that's not what it means it means self- proprietorship the word individual means self proprietorship natural person the term natural person also means the sell proprietorship everything everything means sell proprietorship so Brandon how

do we contract um how do we sign these contracts in a way that limits our liability so if I work for Starbucks and I was signing a contract on behalf of Starbucks I wouldn't have the liability of Starbucks but somehow when people are signing these documents with the IRS they're they're getting the liability of their sole proprietorship how do we separate ourselves from that liability well I can go over that in a moment uh so so definition of a US person for federal tax purposes you are

considered a US person if you are uh a sole proprietorship who was a US citizen or us resident alien a partnership Corporation company or Association created or organized in the United States which means the District of Columbia or under the laws of the District of Columbia an State other than a foreign state which would mean anything outside of the District of Columbia or a US Territory or possession so for example if you create a business in state of California that gets complicated because that's actually the

the business you're creating a business underneath the business and that business happens to be a federal business but the thing is is that they they don't want anyone to know that so so you could you could start to do [ __ ] and it'll work because the thing is they don't want anyone they don't want to let anyone say that as a defense so there's a lot of crazy [ __ ] you can do but then we have a domestic trust a foreign trust would not be a us person a foreign estate would not be a

us person a corporation company partnership Association that wasn't created under the laws of the District of Colombia wouldn't be a us person and a so proprietorship who's not a US citizen wouldn't be a us person and what's a US citizen under the 14th Amendment it's a released slave that doesn't have citizenship that need citizenship and does not include white people literally straight up does not include white people white people cannot be US citizens I love it so if you're a white

person and you say you're a US citizen guess what brother you're going to [ __ ] prison for up to three years [Laughter] now the problem is is that you know people watching this might be kind of scared oh [ __ ] I've been saying US citizen yeah but this is the word that saves you willfully so so if you're watching this show and you continue to say that you are a US citizen as a white person you are now willfully misrepresenting yourself now you're committing a felony so I I have I

have released you from your bondage uh but at the same time I've placed you into a different kind of bondage because now if you're watching this show I have activated 18 USC 911 in your life and if you continue to say that you are a US citizen you are putting yourself up to three years in prison you'll never ever ever in a billion years ever be prosecuted for this they would never ever ever ever ever do that because they don't want anyone knowing this any this information but I like to say this

because I think it's important for people most people are honest people and if they don't want to be someone set up as a felon you're set up as a felon so if I were to assign one of these w9s I'd be a felon am I ever going to get prosecuted for it no but I'm a felon in my mind I'm an I'm basically a felon that hasn't been prosecuted yet so Brandon we we've signed all these documents uh how do we get out of these agreements that we've tacitly signed over the years um you know because now

we know about them and we don't want to willfully commit any kind of fraud so how do we get out of these agreements well I doubt I I doubt even you should even get into this because your your audience being older and and Wealthy are probably not working in a nine-to-five job but the answer to a nine-to-five job situation would be the W8 benen that that that this is for foreign s proprietorships if you're in California you're foreign to United States so you give you're you're a foreign beneficial

owner of whatever work that you're doing at whatever job you would give them you would give your job this w8ben form and I teach you how to fill this out on my free Contract Killer course but the answer for um your your audience your demographic is totally different than that the answer for your demographic would be uh literally just a change of address form basically right uh I mean well actually the the the better choice the better choice actually wouldn't be this form actually uh the better choice would be

to convert all of your businesses companies corporations associations and Partnerships into foreign trusts just like Nick was saying earlier on the show I don't know if we were saying that off camera or on camera nick uh but but the the correct so so so the original trust indenture is the birth certificate of the trust you who the grantor is the one who writes the trust the grantor decides the birthplace of the person called the trust and then it's given to a trustee and then the trustee can naturalize that

trust from the birthplace anywhere they want at any point in time by any means whatsoever again 8 USC 11101 now again we're starting to get into international law now at this point so so so we have to just take it take a little bit of a breather here because the thing is that if it's born in some other country because the the grantor wrote the trust and denture to say that the Articles of Incorporation called the trust and denture was born in another country this definition of the term naturalization coming from the US code

would only apply if if if if if the trust was being naturalized into the United States I assume because I've studied a lot of international law I would assume most places have a very similar definition to this most countries because it's actually this is based off of international law right the term naturalization means the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth by any means whatsoever the birth of a trust would be the trust indenture okay what about a revocation

of election with the IRS like filing a form that says hey I'm not under your jurisdiction anymore and La you stop I stopped doing those and the reason why I stopped doing those is because of 26 USC 7701 subsection a39 which I will show you uh I used to do those and then I stopped doing those uh if any citizen or resident of the United States does not reside in and is not found in any United States Judicial District such citizen or resident shall be treated as residing in the district of Colombia for purposes of

any provision of this title meaning the tax code relating to jurisdiction of courts or enforcement of summons so uh I used to do this thing called the revocation of election which clarifies a lot of this information the problem is the sole proprietorship was born in the United States the sole proprietorship is a US citizen uh I can show you that based off of 42 USC 9102 will go back to the definition of United States citizen uh subsection a is the definition on that means any individual who is a citizen of

the United States by law birth or naturalization the word individual means so proprietorship any s proprietorship that is born in the district of Colombia a US insulant possession or territory is by definition a US citizen so no matter what you say trying to move that US citizen outside of the District of Columbia when it comes to summons or jurisdiction of Courts it doesn't matter where that US citizen is in the planet it's still considered as though it's in the district of Colombia because it was

created by the District of Colombia so Brandon the real remedy is those to have a foreign trust where the money you make have a foreign trust is earned outside of the United States this entity is born outside of the United States so the answer the answer is simple you've got this business this business is basically stuck in DC Forever just stop using it if you create a foreign trust you could create a foreign trust called Brandon Joe Williams right that's what I did you know and it gets crazier you

could create 400 trusts called Brandon Joe Williams and then when the IRS calls you and they say we want to talk to Brandon Joe Williams there's 400 here which one you want to talk to well there's 401 there's 401 of us which one do you want to talk to okay that's that's an interesting tactic too you can you can you know the thing is is that the thing is is that a lot of this is is designed to confuse you when you understand it now you can turn around and you can use it as offensive mechanism to confuse

them doesn't cost you anything to open up 400 trusts I mean if you do it yourself if you don't hire someone else to do it right right right in my course I teach you how to make a foreign Trust From Scratch uh make 400 foreign trusts and and put them all over the world and call them all Brandon Joe Williams I love it and you can even naturalize them into to pickle teria right then yeah of course you don't have to you can you can create your own nation and you can naturalize them into

your own Nation mine are cool mine mine are actually born in my own Nation so the actual trust and denture the birth of my trusts are my own personal private Nation so so in order for them to go anywhere in order for them to to link up with or interact with the United States at all they have to be naturalized they have to be naturalized you ask how do you naturalize it you just draw up your own personal certificate of naturalization as a trustee I hereby as the trustee of this trust coming from the nation of the

animy Coalition hereby uh uh naturalize the trust into California so it's a foreign born trust naturalized into California the banks and everybody else think that that's part of the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States it's not it's still a Sovereign Nation yes it is so it's a Sovereign Nation a a manufactured Sovereign Nation creating a trust and then naturalizing that trust into another Sovereign Nation no one knows California is a Sovereign Nation so you start you start pull you start

talking like this and lawyers just [ __ ] run oh they can't handle it they run like worse than if you were a burning building worse than a hooker with AIDS they are they are they are it's like Wy coyote in uh in the old in the old cartoons when I was a kid Wy coyote it's it's just the the the the Road Runner you know and you just see like the the smoke outline of the body that's how that's how fast people people go away from from this [ __ ] when you start talking like this amazing so we

we've got a couple other subjects if you still got some energy left uh one is a negotiable instruments and and the other one is I'd like to kind of revisit talk about your SBA trial because I know that's your your favorite one these days I read all your AMX stuff and I find it fascinating and I I actually find it amazing that they uh didn't treat you very well in that and I want to hear like what you're planning on doing you know if you can talk about it all all the cases are here on on on

Williams and Williams um and and basically the way it works is you just go to uh uh current and previous litigation page and you go down you can see all the various cases now the way it works is you go to What's called Pacer yes so so Pacer people don't realize this Pacer this is for all federal cases and then State cases have a different system for each state you can get into and you can create a login and then you can you can type in case numbers and you can look up any doc item for any case

anywhere including Wesley Snipes celebrities OJ Simpson whatever you want as long as it hasn't been sealed or whatever you can download the case documents for typically like 10 to 20 cents per page right now when it comes to Federal cases all the federal cases are here on Pacer now uh what I did was there's a there's this thing called the free law project and the free law project what they do is if you if you have it installed in your browser as a browser extension it's called recap

which is just Pacer backwards and you can even see that here on the recap website if you hover over recap archive there's that little shadow that comes down and it says Pacer underneath it's kind of cool right so so what court listener is by the free law project is is basically it's it's if you as long as you have this extension in if anyone buys the item in Pacer it's automatically crowdsourced for free for everyone else in real recap so you can see here Buy on payer Buy on payer

download PDF so so recap is a resource where you can go onto recap and you can look up docket items and you can read them without having to have a Pacer account and without having to pay for the item so you just click on download PDF and then you are instantaneously taken to the docket item y so recap super cool I I started converting everything over to recap because I wanted to make everything more accessible for people so so uh all of my cases all have uh recap links and uh you're just going to go through here and

you can read my personal remarks and you can read everything and then you can go to the the recap so for example if you went down to the the the cases are obviously my my personal cases are the ones that are the most exciting to people so obviously those you can see every single item is blue all the way down um this one is just a text notice this one doesn't even have a you can see here text only that doesn't even have an item associated with it so you you can't actually even buy this this is just a

placeholder so you can see every single item um except this one proposed order it looks like from uh a couple weeks ago it looks like that's the only item this is a text only as well I don't think this one had yeah text only entry so this one wouldn't have an item and then this one here's another proposed order so so two proposed orders by the doj attorneys are the only items on this entire docket that you would have to go into Pacer view on Pacer to get those if you wanted to see those and it even

tells you on recap how much you're going to pay for those items this item would be 20 cents and this item would be 20 cents and if you have the recap browser installed in your browser when you buy those then this would go from this to Blue and it would be available for everyone from that point forward it's pretty freaking cool pretty cool pretty cool I'm definitely a huge fan of the law project uh the free law project I am a donator $10 a month it's not very much but I am a donator a monthly donator to

the free law project uh specifically because I think what they're doing is so cool and and it makes all this stuff easy to access the cost is not doesn't sound like much but when you're looking through a docket like for example the Wesley Snipes trial there's 600 docket items yeah and it's 10 cents per page so that's 600 docket items and then each docket item on average may be you know 10 pages that's 6,000 pages of of material at 10 cents per page that adds up real [ __ ] fast

yeah yeah so if you want to do real deep dive research recap is a it will save you hundreds of dollars and it is a very very valuable research uh uh uh a resource okay so so with that said uh I say we just get into into the negotiable instruments honestly let's go that's that's what everybody wants to hear this is the wealth architect podcast let's go so so this is the financial arm of all of my research um this is where the all the stuff that I've taught you so far doesn't necessarily marry up to all this

it's almost kind of like an entirely separate research Matrix it it does it does in some ways but not not really it's kind of like its own separate world I guess you'd say kind of in general right so so so while it's really cool uh and and for this kind of a demographic it's probably for taxation is probably the coolest part about it uh but but really the tax argument is just set up a foreign trust and then never file a tax return ever again that's that's the but I but you have to take the guy through

the whole story to to say something that simple and and then not think you're crazy or or criminal or something do you know what I mean so we had to walk that line to get down to uh uh one sentence answered and never pay taxes again for as long as you live oh and then um there is actually a part of the internal revenue manual that actually says literally word for word I guess I can I can actually show that real quick just to end off on that last section foreign entities SLP persons not required to file a US tax return 21.7.13

3.2.7 do1 which was last update dated in 2018 I've been using this for quite some time foreign corporations and individuals not oh oh I'm so glad we looked here oh oh oh this is this is going to be I I can't believe I spaced on one of the most important things in all of Taxation that's just going to REI this is g to this this right here is g to be the coolest okay this whole show probably because of where your people are at this is going to be the coolest thing in the whole show sorry

this is the coolest thing foreign corporations and individuals not engag in a Trader business now this this is where your boys your audience is gonna get pissed off you ready for this one let's go so so let's look at a 1040 form right uh uh 1044 right says the same terminology on the Le hand side uh it says here trade uh or business right where does it say it trade or business [ __ ] maybe it's the other one um trade or business you'll see this trade or business trade or business

income dang maybe they change this one too gosh dang it they're changing all my stuff all right Schedule C it's uh it's on the 104 tra Trader business Trader business check this out Trader business brother what what is the definition of trade or business oh trade or buiness of course Trader business Trader business USC uh 26 USC uh uh 7701 subsection a26 what is the definition of the term trade or business includes the performance of the functions of a public office what's so so so first and

foremost what's the definition of the word includes they use that as another legal term to confusing includes means only and exclusively the following items not including anything else because you got to think the definition of the word definition means a boundaries of meaning so like for example let's say you ask me Brandon what is a fruit and I say well a fruit would include bananas you didn't [ __ ] answer my question at all but what you don't realize is the the word includes when when you're

talking about a legal definition it means only and exclusively the following items same thing as what we saw in in the definition of State Court from uh 28 USC 1442 I believe it uses the word includes includes the doj attorney on the phone was like oh includes that just means like additional things of which it could be yeah but it doesn't [ __ ] that that would make it not a definition it wouldn't be a definition by definition at that point plus you can't assume because they're not saying State

of California that because you we use the oh it includes these things but it also includes State of California no you [ __ ] prick it doesn't if it included the state of California it would be in the definition they use this word includes all the time it's very very tricky it's a bar I call it a bar card special this is a bar card special the word includes right includes what is public office it means govern a government a government employee so read this in English the term trade or business means only and

exclusively the performance of the functions of being a government employee so so so so foreign corporations and individuals which means sell proprietorships not engaged in the performance of the functions of government office in the United States which means the District of Colombia us territor is in insular possessions so if so if you have a a a foreign corporation would be a corporation in California yeah which is not under the exclusive jurisdiction of the national government right so that's you know so so so and

foreign Partnerships foreign trusts and foreign Estates that do not have gross income which you're going to get into in a second Inc comes that's [ __ ] that is or is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a Trader business business are required to obtain an EIN unless they otherwise have United States Source income on which the tax liability was not so so so they're saying is is the the trader business thing is really important and then the United States thing is really important and we go down

here but Brandon you could still you could still have an EIN and not be required to file taxes correct yeah those are typically 98s so so so any Ein that starts with a 98 number uh is a foreign EIN number but I i' I get I get E's uh literally issued I put on their one 123 Purple Monkey Lane pckl Taria the nation of the amnesty Coalition I put my own madeup Nation on the ss4 application for EIN numbers they give me Ein but they don't start with a 98 they start with the weird ass numbers

so I don't know uh I think that rabbit hole is a little deeper than what people think it is because I'm literally putting madeup Nations on there and they're they're giving me EIN numbers and they're not foreign so I don't know what they're the I don't know what they're you know I think I think the 98s are exclusively foreign and then other ones are who knows it's just a big it's kind of a big occult sector this whole number I just got mine back and I didn't specify what

nation they were in I just kind of left that open but I mailed them in and I I didn't put my social security number I didn't put anything on there um so I can say their foreign even if they didn't know that when I applied because they didn't really ask they probably won't give you did they give you Ein off that they probably won't give you einin off that you're kidding me oh my God that's crazy man yeah so I when I first started teaching all this the they locked everything down and they stopped giving

Ein and then and then recently I've been getting a lot of reports they're giving Ein even looser than they were before I started all that I don't know what happened I think maybe this whole Trump tearing through everything like a bull in a china shop may have something to do with it I don't know but but something's going on because they tightened up their butthole really really really crazy for a while and then now it's just it's just like a [ __ ] jungle out there now I

mean they're not supposed to issue EI and those really they're not I know I know the rules better than they do and they should have issued those E I talked to them on the phone and she said they wouldn't issue them if I didn't put a social security number on there but I didn't put a social security number on there I mailed them in uh and I just put trust organization and I didn't put any really I left a lot of stuff blank I signed as the trustee and it took four to six weeks but I got I got two of them

sent back and so I two foreign trust now yeah now now just as a quick side note the whole you have to have a Social Security number to that's all falls it's Lally right in the irm it tells you if there's no social security number you write for in with a capital f I know I know literally even capital F you don't have to do capital F but I remember the irm says literally capital F you write foreign right and I did that I wrote foreign I did as for the irm and they denied me and they said

I had to have fa I'm like guys it says right in the irm I don't need a SSN and I can do foreign right but anyways so so so so technically if you write nothing they they they should be denying that and sending you back and saying that if if you don't have an SSN you're supposed to write for in that box but because they don't know any of this either you know so it's just crazy plus if you don't write the nation that the thing is coming from then how can it naturalize because in order for it to be

naturalize it has to be born if it was born it h it has to have some kind of originating location so without an originating location how can you prove that it's born if you can't prove that it's born you can't naturalize it because the definition of naturalization after birth by any means whatsoever so Birth has to happen first before something can be moved and naturalized so but the thing is nobody knows any of this you send some [ __ ] in and it's just it's just you're just

rolling the dice every single time you never never know what you're going to get but it's just hilarious to me literally you know what I started doing I started sending in docs they get they get denied I'd wait a week and just resend them I started doing that with a lot of agencies send them in they get denied I wait a week send them in they get denied I wait a week send them in they get approved crazy crazy but if you look on if you look on this I'm getting some feedback Guys somebody all of a sudden the feedback

started it's weird I'm getting echo on my end okay now I'm not okay so so so this is it right here right if the foreign entities individuals above receive a letter from the IRS soliciting the filing of a US tax return the foreign entity individual should respond to the letter immediately by stating that it has no requirement to file any us tax return s this is basically like a little micro uh uh revocation of election which we're not going to get into because I don't use it anymore but th this in

itself one sentence yeah uh uh uh the uh uh uh the foreign entities individual should respond to the letter immediately by stating it it could be one sentence in accordance with 27 21713 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah section three uh uh this uh uh entity SL individual has no requirement to file any us tax returns word by word word by word it I would literally start here I would copy here copy here paste here paste it into the into the I would even do quotations yeah in accordance with irm 21713 blah blah blah BL subsection 3 uh

uh this quote entity SL individual end quote uh uh uh quote has no requirement to file any us tax returns end quote you're not going to argue with that it's your [ __ ] words [ __ ] not mine I'm not trying to argue with you and then below that sincerely agent Brandon Joe Williams sign it send it in one sentence bang bang bang that's beautiful that's just beautiful it doesn't tell you it doesn't tell you to say why it doesn't say stating why it has no requirement to file us tax returns it

just says stating that it has you wouldn't say it I have no requirement because it's foreign and because it's this and because of Trader business and because it's not in public office and because it's not in the United States United States is exclusive jurisdiction of the District of Columbia US territories and possessions no you don't say any of that you say say it has no requirement to file any us tax returns thank you sincerely Brandon Jo Williams we got it simplest thing in the

world the the other type of entity Brandon that is not required to file is a church or Ministry so that's something for your listeners to keep in mind as well well that get that that that depends on the structure that depends on the structure like for example um if you go down that rabbit hole you're going to find what's called called a um uh uh uh a corporation Soul which is another type of really unique uh a corporation that was created for the pope and stuff like that and that's that that's the bottom line is is

a church can be a trust or it can be a corporation that's right for example all the churches in in in the US in the US United States as well as in the SE the states of the Union uh they're all filed as as if they are in the US and they're what's called 503 C1 503 C1 is a church that's in the District of Columbia or US Territory or ins possession so a 508 c1a would be a trust that's that's foreign that that has nothing to do with so there's two different types of church

filing as well and it's still it's still just comes down to the same it's the same it's still the same thing it's just a a foreign trust versus a domestic trust really it that's really all that matters the the whole church thing and I'm going to create a church so I can be tax exempt it it it's it's it's yeah there's a whole Rabbit Hole to that but there's still two types of church too there's still the corporate church that's plugged in now now the way that would work is if

it's a corporate church that's plugged in the 503 C1 now at that point they're exempt only under 10 billion different rules of exemption whereas if there're a 508 C1 a there are no rules because it's foreign it's got nothing to do with anything so the this the the if you want the complicated long convoluted route you would create a church and then it would be a 503 C1 and then you would get some 503 C1 accountant that knows all the rules and then you would have special books

and special this and you'd have this and the IRS can come and audit your books whenever they want and you'd have these audited books and these non- audited books and You' set up this whole big Abate scheme in order for it to be tax exempt or you just simply open up a foreign trust and then you never need to file tax return ever again and it's over and you don't need to follow any rules you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want so it's up to you it's just that because everyone so confused and nobody knows

anything and because accountants need to make money this 503 C1 thing is the biggest croc of [ __ ] on the planet and you don't have to have a church it can be non-religious or religious as long as it's a foreign trust it makes no [ __ ] difference if you want an added layer of security you just call the you just call the trust Ministry Church or Ministry trust Brandon Joe Williams Ministry is trust it's a foreign trust and it's a Ministry now they're really not going to [ __ ] want to have anything to do with

it you can double it up love it doesn't require you to do much of anything what are you gonna do you're gonna come and tell me what my religion is what the [ __ ] a government's going to tell me the definition of religion yeah good luck with that one in a court of law you see what I I mean you can you could say anything you want you could worship [ __ ] uh you know concrete uh uh sidewalks you know whatever whatever you want you know so yep so getting into the negotiable instrument conversation right

we have um we have a Federal Reserve Note right Federal Reserve Note you've seen one of these before uh Federal Reserve Note is is Federal Reserve Note right so so we start going down the rabbit hole of of what is money and we we start to think that oh it's money nope nope nope so Article 1 Section 10 of the Constitution no State shall make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payments of debts now how do they get around this this is really really old this is a capitalized s but this is actually

should be lowercase but this is so old that there was no difference back then so you have to do the whole historical uh thing to to kind of figure all that out right this is all the way back at the the very beginning 1776 so so what they're saying here is they're talking about the the the there wasn't even 50 states at that time they're talking about just the the states of the Union at that time uh how many states were there when the Constitution was written so what they're talking

about is the 13 states 13 right yeah so so so this quote is um talking about 13 states so if we were to take those 13 states uh and what list of original 13 states that signed the constit let's get a list um where's the list at here we go so so let's reread this in English or or or this isn't even legal e this is just old um uh New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island Conneticut New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Delaware Maryland Virginia North Carolina South Carolina and Georgia

shall not make anything but gold and silver coin a payment uh in a tender in payments of debt and you say is the District of Colombia included in that list the answer is no wow that's how they got around this that's how they got around the Constitution right the the District of Columbia has nothing to do with the Constitution okay and then we have the definition of money and usual and ordinary acceptation it means Gold Silver and paper money or paper money used as a circulating medium of exchange and does not

Embrace notes bonds evidences of debt or other personal or real estate does not Embrace does not notes crazy and what do we see on the Federal Reserve Note Federal Reserve Note does not not Embrace notes so that means the legal definition of the word money uh uh would not so it's basically gold silver coins or uh silver certificates or gold certificates so if we go back to back in the day we had these things called silver certificates and they look very similar I have a bunch of them over here on my

counter yeah I have some there's also gold certificates and what they say on them is they they literally say right on them you know can be exchanged for 1 ooun of gold uh payable to On Demand right so so this certifies that there is on deposit in the treasury of the United States of America one dollar and then you look up the definition of the word dollar the legal definition and it's an exact and specific weight uh uh legal definition of dollar in terms of a a silver coin is what weight 3

71.2 grains and this comes from the coinage act of 1792 so the word dollar uh when it comes to a silver certificate means 371.50 grain or 24.05 s g of f fine silver which I believe fine silver is defined as 999 or above what is the definition of fine silver let's see here 999 so 90.9 so so the legal definition of a dollar in terms of silver is is is 24.05 G of 999 or above silver that is the exact specific definition that would be the exact specific definition of the word money so we're looking at a silver

certificate so what they're saying is this certifies uh that there is on deposit at the treasury of the United States of America what this this is payable to the bearer on demand one coin which happens to be a dollar which would mean uh two 4.57 G of silver of the grade of 999 or above that is the exact that is the exact full contract of what one of these things was and then for gold it was the same thing but it had a different weight to it so so so what is the legal definition of dollar in terms of a gold

coin uh uh weight F silver fine gold 23.22 grein of fine gold yeah and that's from 1834 I'm not sure if gold was standardized in 1979 1792 it might have been just silver uh I would need to go into this in more depth but you're starting to get get the the I mean the idea is that's precious metal are backed by precious metal yeah dollar you you wouldn't say this says $1 dollar that's actually that's actually psychotic and and they must have redefined the word dollar because this isn't the dollar it can't

be a dollar it has nothing to do with the word dollar and it it isn't a dollar it's a note so Brandon why does that note say United States of America and not just the unit States well that's the part I don't know because if you go to UCC 9307 which is talking about the debt tour associated with the promiser note called the Federal Reserve Note and you go down to location of United States the United States is located in the District of Columbia so I I have no idea because the the the Federal Reserve

Note has nothing to do with the United States of America it only has to do with the United States so the thing is is that dollar and and of America the these things shouldn't be on there at all and I guarantee you if you dig and you dig and you dig and you dig you're going to find some crazy part of some ACT somewhere where they redefine the term of and they redefine the word America and they redefine the word dollar guaranteed probably in the Federal Reserve Act something like that or or the Emergency

Banking Act and the gold abreg 1833 right is is in God we trust a foreign trust I I I I've heard theories that it it's literally a trust that's called In God we we so that's the that's the theory I don't have any circumstantial evidence I have nothing to point you to on that that is just a a theory I've heard floating around and if I had to any hope in Hell of proving that in the court of law I I wouldn't I would start digging really hard I'd probably find what I

need to prove that in the court of law but I don't have any of that currently accessible to me hey it's Mark YY here to tell you about our cash flow machine trading program that's designed to teach you how to make safe reliable income now we shoot for 2 to 4% a month of income and growth in your portfolio and we have courses to teach you how to do this yourself or inside a mastermind community and the best part of that is it only takes about 20 minutes a week to implement now while 2 to 4% a month

doesn't sound like much I show you exactly how we took my IRA from $111,000 to over 500,000 in just 19 months without huge risk I'm not telling you this to brag just to show you that you can do this too so to learn more about this program go to cash flow machine. that's Cashflow machine. and you can learn [Music] more so what is this thing this this if it's not money and it isn't a dollar uh uh uh and without going into a bunch of old crazy court cases if you go into the 1800s you start looking up uh

financial and banking cases especially at the Supreme Court level what they call uh um uh uh uh money back then is they called it this word called specii and I can do I don't know if you can hear it specii if I hit the button here can you hear this no you don't have the uh sound turned on that's okay whatever it's specii spey and you can hear it clicking on that thing right money in the form of coins rather than notes right so so so we start getting into what is this thing what is a

promiser note and how the hell can it move around and what what is it if it's not money and it isn't specii well what is it you look up the definition of the word currency currency does include uh bills notes and other evidence of debt so so it's legally US currency that's why they use the term US currency they don't use the word money you'll never see the word money you see the term US currency because it is currency and it's from the US which is the District of Columbia US territories and insul

possessions okay so we start getting into what is this thing and the answer to it is in UCC Uniform Commercial Code article 3 section 104 and this is all very confusing and we can get into this in great depth and I did a whole series called a journey into ucc3 where we go through every single section of all of UCC article three line by line and word by word it's pretty cool I'm dressed up in like crazy outfits and stuff it's pretty wild it's great great but to keep it really really really simple this is

like 90% of what you need to know about this information right here in this one little section right here negotiable instrument means an unconditional promise or order to pay that's it if we just stopped right there I'm telling you you you got there's more to it and there's a whole rabbit hole we can get crazy into it and do all this craziness the word instrument basically just means like a document it's a really really really vague term it could mean like a document it could mean like almost anything

really and then the word negotiable means transferable and it typically refers to like has some kind of value or monetary value so so negotiable instrument means some sort of document or paper or object or security that has some sort of intrinsic value and can be transferred between parties uh uh uh uh where where it basically holds that value right so that's what a negotiable instrument is if we go to UCC 3-102 we're going to see something really shocking they make the clarification on

this right uh this article applies to negotiable instruments it does not apply to Money Money Federal Reserve notes are not money it's two completely different worlds and if you start getting into uh title 12 of the United States code all about banking they call it foreign gold and silver foreign coins why do they call it foreign because California and Utah and Texas and New Hampshire and New York and Washington and Idaho and Montana and this and that are all foreign Sovereign Nations the standard

uh uh uh money supply or currency Supply in California it's actually illegal to use Federal Reserve notes in California for you when I read the original Constitution they literally have [ __ ] exact sections this this [ __ ] is so old this whole convert everything into a negotiable instrument to the banking industry and then take over a whole country by doing it is old as dirt because you can read that they were trying to prevent that from happening in the original 1849 Constitution if we go

down to article 4 section let me find this real quick uh for you this is really really cool I think it's section here it is uh now remember 1849 is when California was introduced into the Union okay and there's a whole backstory on that Mexico and all that right so so um let's see here uh section 34 this is article let me find the article for you it's very important article four uh section 34 says and did they ever repeal this document this constitution no because they they can't so what did they do they

just created a new state called State of California right that's what they did they couldn't get rid of this thing so what did they do they created a new state that has almost the same name they gave that new state a totally different Constitution and then they were able to amend change and eliminate that Constitution amazing and that was totally fine there's nothing stopping there was never anything legally stopping anyone from doing that right the the the legislature shall have no

power to pass any act granting any Charter for banking purposes but associations may be formed under general laws for the deposit of gold and silver but no such Association shall make issue or put in circulation any Bill check ticket certificate promissary note or any or other paper or the paper of any bank to circulate as money it's right there wow Federal Reserve notes now Federal Reserve notes are totally legal in state of California California in California they are completely illegal and then we go down here check

this out section 35 and you got to think these guys th obviously they're trying to combat something because why would they put this craziness in here with all this terminology and all these words and all the specific [ __ ] the legislature of this state and they capitalize the word State they didn't realize they didn't have a [ __ ] time machine to go in the future and realize that they were going to [ __ ] with these words real bad and [ __ ] everybody over and change all this stuff so they capitalize the word s not

knowing that right the legislature of this state plus you got a it's just simple grammar it's a it's a proper versus common noun right they're talking about this state a specific state so they they're they're actually using normal grammar as well here okay the legislation of this state shall prohibit by law any person or persons Association company or Corporation from exercising the Privileges of banking or creating paper to circulate as money yeah they knew they knew the

power this is this this tactic of the negotiable instruments and converting the entire currency Supply from from gold and silver coins to negotiable instruments is old as dust my friend this is Dusty Dusty Dusty Dusty Dusty old so so so getting back into all of this right so we start to realize Okay so we've got money which is gold and silver coins we have dollar which is a specific weight associated with these gold and silver coins it has to be of a certain quality of silver or gold 999 which is defined

as fine silver gold may have another term but if we use the same term it'd be fine gold okay okay okay then we've got this thing called a Federal Reserve Note we've got it figured out it's it's a it's a it's a it's a promiser note which would be a negotiable instrument there's only two types of negotiable instruments unconditional promise to pay or order to pay so we got it all figured out we've got it all figured out now we start getting into my flowchart so this is the flowchart as to

exactly how negotiable instruments operate how are they created how are they trans transferred the terminology associated with how they're transferred so this is the world that we live in people think that we live in this old world where you have these money or these coins or these dollars and they move around and they have value and it's all very simple that's not even remotely close we live in a banker's world and everything is a security the word security and the word negotiable

instrument is the same thing so imagine what's in your wallet and what's in your bank account is the exact same [ __ ] that's on Wall Street if you think about it that way you you got the correct you have a correct attitude you have a correct perception to the situation you don't have any money you've probably never had any money I got money all over the place I love having it and touching it and smelling it I want it right but if you don't know what money is which nobody does including billionaires and

and and rich people which which I'm sure you have that watch your show uh uh uh uh you may invest in silver coins or gold coins you got to think uh uh Congress said that no nothing shall be money except coins gold and silver coins so what's the definition of word coin let's say you have in your basement you have a a a a big safe and it has a huge gold bar inside of it would that gold bar be considered money legally no if you were to melt down that gold bar into shapes of coins it'd be considered money so so

you also have that it's at that point it's basically bullying it hasn't become a coin yet so it couldn't legally be money yet but it has the potential to very rapidly become what's classified as money so so when you it's all about definitions in law right so if you have a bunch of gold and silver coins like I do I've got bars and coins and all sorts of crazy stupid [ __ ] it's it's actually money at that point it can be transferred but the thing is there is no

legal structure anymore to to legally like like if you go and and and buy and sell with silver coins and you go to uh file a lawsuit in state or federal court because the state courts are just Federal too they're just they're part of State of California the the federal they're basically Federal zon essentially they they don't have any ability or jurisdiction to do anything about that like like if you want to find out Brandon is State of California or state of Utah are these courts

actual state courts or are they actually federal courts that pretend is though state courts the fastest and easiest way to answer that question is go and buy something for silver coins and then and then and with your buddy just do some crazy [ __ ] with your buddy and then file a lawsuit based off of an a transaction involving silver coins and watch how fast that [ __ ] gets thrown out right that that that's they can't have but the thing is you just read it California is gold and silver coins

only they can't use Federal Reserve notes so you can also reverse that thinking as well and say to yourself well if that's the case every time a Federal Reserve Note case or anything involving Federal Reserve notes is filed in the state court they'd have to throw it out they obviously aren't doing that so you can see we don't have state courts there are no state courts there are only federal courts there there there is not such thing as a state court doesn't exist hasn't existed for I don't

know how long I would need to do a deep dive on that but we haven't had any state courts for a long time the the the District of Colombia has taken over all of the 48 individual Sovereign Nations that we think it it it's actually a takeover that's why the the USC is so weird still they still have all these definitions and stuff where it doesn't include things like California because practically legally we're still a separate Sovereign Nation but the DMV the banks the state courts

they're all federal everything is essentially Federal and everyone is essentially saying that they live in a federal Zone but the actual original state is still here and there's only a few of us that live in it there's literally like like maybe you know a few hundred people or something or a few thousand I don't know how many who knows You' never know there's no census for the actual State there's only a census for the federal zone so when you read a census about California you're reading a census about

the federal Zone called State of California you're not actually reading any information about the actual California at all so what you're looking at is you're looking at a takeover it's a corporate takeover yeah that's what's actually occurred and and the main instrument or tool that has been used in order to accomplish that corporate takeover is this whole negotiable instrument currency system this is how you motivate everyone to do exactly what you want them to do is you have to control the monetary

Supply doesn't require a [ __ ] rocket scientist to figure that one out I think there's even a quote uh Nelson Rockefeller said you know I don't care who the who the presidents are or who runs the country as long as I control the money supply uh I control the country it's over you know I forget the exact quote you can look it up anyways so we have these two types of negotiable instruments you have an unconditional promise to pay which is called a note or promisory note and then you have the unconditional order to pay

which is called a bill or a bill of exchange or a draft or a check and there's probably other terms too there's there's several terms to describe this one over here this one's much simpler and what's cool is this is the one that you're dealing with all all the time more so than this one this is this is like constantly every time you use a credit card you're you're producing an unconditional promise to pay that is a note in itself that is that is currency it actually has monetary value uh and

then you basically abandon that every month you're manufacturing currency and then abandoning it every single time you use a credit card which I know is pretty shocky amazing yeah so so an unconditional promise to pay which is called a note or promissary note here are some examples when you sign a traffic ticket it is a note if you sign it and more of a draft if you didn't are you promising to perform or are you being ordered to perform that's what makes the difference between these two right and there's

really not that much difference between these two so don't think like it's two entirely separate subjects that are both their own complicated thing this one's a little different than this one I mean really it's it's really there's hardly any difference frankly frankly there's really not right um there's a few there's a few uh uh Hues of difference and that's about it right so loan promissary notes all credit card transactions Federal Reserve notes and my theory is every single country that

has a central Reserve uh a central a Reserve Bank a central bank operates using all of this same information so basically what I'm teaching you is not just an American thing as far as I know and this is a theory of mine I haven't I haven't fully fleshed this out but I my theory is that this is the Once the Central Bank goes in all of this goes in with it yeah this is the this is the system we're looking at the system okay insurance policies you are the beneficiary and they are the

trustees once they fund the trust with a note right you you fund your own insurance policies guys that's yeah you're going to learn that in this flowchart right and then we have the unconditional order to pay which basically there's two different classes okay well there's really one class and then there's like a subclass that attaches to that class so it's called a draft if it contains banking routing and account numbers on it it's a draft and then now also a check people think that it has to have

routing and account numbers on it no it doesn't so so so if we take a check and we're going to go to the check which this is all sorts of information can be pulled off one of these bad boys so so so here's here's a check see if we can get a picture pulled up this is a pretty good picture Okay so so pay to the order of that's actually that's actually terminology straight out of all of these acts and stuff it literally says that an unconditional order to pay has to have this exact terminology on it pay to the

order of right it has to have the date it has to have the amount in figures and words when you read things like the bill of exchange act it says has to have the amount in figures and terms so figures is the numbers and then terms is the and then it even says that if if the figure is different from the terms the terms are the senior uh uh thing so if you wrote $400 here and you wrote $4,000 in words it's actually a $44,000 check not a $400 check by the way yep and then down here people don't realize

if you look on a check it says mp on the side that stands for micro print and then if you look really really close uh microprint on a check you will see if you look very very close on your checks pull your checkbooks out of your wall out of your out of your uh closet you have an older demographic which is great cuz they're actually going to have checks younger demographic won't have any of these they don't even know what you're talking about uh so so this is really good pull out

your checkbook for for everybody watching this and you're going to see here MP that stands for micro print and then you're going to zoom in on this line where you sign and you're going to see it says authorized signature over and over and over and over and over and over again get out of here what is do it right now do you have checks grab your checks right now I actually do have a check here yeah on a check you see it yeah I'm actually in a different country so I'm pulling it up and I can't

see that small but let G get my phone out you have to use uh if you see the MP there that means that it's there if you see the MP then oh there's an M there's an MP so you'll have to get a a magnifying class yeah and look really really really really really really close it says authorized signature over and over and over and over and over sure does amazing pretty well cool yeah so so what is authorized signature this is straight out of Google this is not Freeman onthel land. co.net this is not

uh uh uh you know crazy Psychopathic weird individual ual.com website this is Google guys you know you you this is not anything crazy and if you don't believe Google you can go deeper you'll find the same information some things aren't true from Google I've gone on these these deep Dives so so I wouldn't show you something if an authorized signature on a check refers to the signature of a person who has been officially designated to sign checks on behalf of a business yeah what is the soul

proprietorship a business Bingo you are the signer on behalf of a business called Branden Jo Williams again I I feel like I have the answer but it is circumstantial I have nothing directly connecting the birth certificate to the soulle proprietorship that I can show you at this time but I'm going to ask you a question and I think it's a question everybody should be asking where the [ __ ] did this business come come from from that that I know people should be asking I think I have the answer and I

think I have circumstantial evidence toward that answer I've I've already presented that that would be uh a bit of a Hail Mary in court uh because what what there there's nothing I don't have anything that directly connects the birth certificate to this thing this business but it it it we you know we can answer the question but the question itself is almost more powerful than the answer where the [ __ ] did this thing come from yeah it's not you obv clearly it's not you yeah ask the government ask

the bank ask the government where the pound the table with your fist as hard as you [ __ ] can where the [ __ ] did this thing come from I want a [ __ ] answer oh I don't know that's not an answer where did this thing come from I never signed up for this thing I never signed up for a business where did this thing come from and why does it have my name on it did I did you give someone did someone give someone else the rights to the name when you look at your mom's freaking name on a long form birth

certificate do you know what your your mom is is called on a long Farm birth certificate your mom is called an informant oh that's right informant parent or other informant the [ __ ] does that mean does that mean that Mom's giving State of California the right to use this name to open a soul proprietorship I don't know I don't know the answer to the question yeah I really don't and and I didn't even know about the so proprietorship until a couple months ago so this is this an

ongoing this is an ongoing uh uh uh research project I don't have all the answers in fact I'm glad I don't because I'd be bored because I'm having a blast okay yeah and you got some good questions but I'll tell you think that's a trust right Brandon I pretty sure it can operate as a trust it definitely it can hold so the definition of a trust is is okay if it's a trust who's the grantor who's the trustee who's the who's the beneficiary and what's the re there has to be an

asset inside the trust there has to be res if there's no res there's no trust now now let's say mom as the informant was giving State of California which is a federal Zone the right to use that name as power of attorney if that's the case then she then they can open up trusts Estates Partnerships associations companies corporations s proprietorships and maybe there's a whole bunch of these things I I say s proprietorship because from a legal angle from a litigation angle it makes the most sense and also

from a financial angle it makes the most sense but when you start getting into things like Social Security the sell proprietorship angle starts to make less sense and the trust angle starts to make more sense wouldn't the wouldn't being the agent of the of that business of that s proprietorship put you in liability no because you have to have some sort of commercial entity in order to interface into the banking and Commercial world if you didn't have a s proprietorship they they can't connect

you into any of the stuff that I'm showing you without some kind of s proprietorship because the Commerce Clause uhuh the Commerce Clause the Commerce Clause is this like gigantic [ __ ] massive Iron Gate that's the difference between California and the District of Colombia and and the only way they can get you up to that gate they can't push you through the gate they can only get you up to it the interfacing portal between that world and this world is some has to be some kind of business

if there's no business then there's no there's no interfacing you can't physically interface with that world at all it's it's a physical impossibility how can you interface with it if there's no business there's no jurisdiction you can you can just hand them jurisdiction like people go into court and they say inappropriate Persona that's basically just because they say hey yeah [ __ ] it I know you guys don't have jurisdiction but I'm giving you jurisdiction anyways

that's really the only way you can do it but then it gets more complicated because then you don't fit any of the definitions of the word person anywhere at that point so now even if you give them jurisdiction they can't use statutes on you because you don't none of the statutes apply to you because the word persons in every single [ __ ] thing ever in every single statute from here from A to Z if you aren't a person they can't use statutes they can only use common law at that point right

if they're using common law it's based off of someone's got to be damaged and then the damaged party has to press charges and then it's this whole like weight of morality and then the jury gets involved they they can't they can't do a whole lot with that that's not that's not the that's not why the system was designed the system was designed to drag you into the statutory world and then use the statutes on you yes that's the that's the point so if you aren't Define as a

person it doesn't it doesn't make any sense okay you know what I mean yep so if you sign as the agent for that person though that's where you separate liability out so you can use the person but since you've signed as the agent and I know Brandon you talk about the the UCC section that identifies you know when you sign as a representative of that party you release liability correct yes if you aren't that person then then why would you have the liabilities of that person unless you're

a shy or something like that but it would need to be like a clear a clear contract that you are you are assurity for that thing right so you know uh like I said it's no different than than if you had Starbucks would you sign as Starbucks if you own Starbucks it's stupid it's the same thing they gave you a business somebody gave you a business you know a lot of questions who who gave who made this where did it come from and how did I get it what's its structure did did it have so so the social

security number is the EIN number of the self proprietorship did my mom was the one who applied for a Social Security number so so did this so proprietorship whoever the [ __ ] made it did they already have a number for it and my mom was just trying to get that number that was already made so she could use it and then and then if she and then if she was why why would she do that what what's I mean tr get into a lawsuit get into Discovery and then start deposing people with these kind of questions and and you're going

to have people literally killing themselves going home hanging themselves or people just start disappearing you Inn the case everyone's dead yeah easy peasy right so the thing is is it's it's it's you know um they're they're not allowed to speak on these subjects so um if you hire a bar card attorney they aren't allowed to to to press any of these claims if they do that their bar card will be will be stripped real [ __ ] fast and that's why being prosay or or being

inappropriate Persona or being uh uh without a bar card in in in in litigation is so powerful because you you've now unlocked all of these secret uh uh avenues that are way more powerful than anything they could ever hope to use yeah the problem is is that when you start going down that Avenue they they play dumb and they treat you like you're crazy uh and you're the one who's saddled with having to prove everything and and it's definitely a uphill battle basically yeah right so um getting back

into this right so so so so so so we were on the check we were on the check here where did our check go it's gone um so there's article three and article four of the Uniform Commercial Code article three covers drafts article four covers checks but a check is also a draft it has to be a draft first in order for it to be a check right so if you look up check and we go to back to our check right so so this is a draft and a check because it has routing and account numbers on it but if you were to

physically tear this little section off and leave everything else on it it would still be a draft and that's the thing people don't get it's still an instrument it's still a negoti it still has the same monetary value on it regardless of whether it has a routing and account number on it and you say well Brandon where does the money come from it is money by itself it is money you're man manufacturing currency the routing and account numbers are are are pretty much irrelevant it's

still currency either way right so examples of an unconditional order to pay or draft would be a traffic ticket a parking ticket a tax bill utility bill credit card bill a court order or a judgment a check but it's both a draft and a check so different definitions a debit card transaction medical bills the word bill means draft and then you know you want to go a step F farther pull your bills out or go online and print paper copies or get off of your Auto autopay and start looking at your bills

and down the bottom where there's that detachable part you'll start seeing numbers that sure do look like routing in account numbers and you'll see you'll see weird strings of numbers all over the goddamn thing so another question if you ever get Ed by any banking institution or any other institution that sends you bills you you get into Discovery and you put that bill in as evidence and you start asking questions about those strings of numbers is this a draft or is it a check what

are these numbers if they're routing in account numbers this is actually a check not a draft yeah watch that case get dismissed about as fast as you've ever seen any [ __ ] case get dismissed since the day you were [ __ ] born on this Earth and many of those ALS also say voucher on them and C or coupon and if you look up the words voucher and coupon you see that the payment is that is the payment that is the currency right the word the word the word coupon means an interest payment a dividend payment yeah true

dividend payment a divident payment of what and if you're paying me is it a draft or a check are these routing and account numbers uh sir case dismiss we we we motion to dismiss this case you're you're living in a banker's world my friends okay it's all banking it's all banking right so so so so so unconditional promise to pay so every time you use your credit card you're you're producing an unconditional promise to pay right and then and then you ask yourself here's another great

question really great question where the [ __ ] is this thing going where where is my currency I created this currency where is it well they send you this bill at the end of the month and if you really if you it's really crazy to think about it the bill is basically an Investment Portfolio it's it's literally like a like a freaking Fidelity uh uh Investment Portfolio they're saying you've you've produced and deposited all of these unconditional promises to pay which are all Securities you've manufactured all

of these Securities throughout the month what do you want us to do with all of them and what you're doing is you're abandoning all of those manufactured Securities you're basically saying I don't I don't claim them I don't really need them I don't want them here I'm going to give you these other Securities instead called Federal Reserve notes and it gets really crazy if you go down to a certificate of deposit for your older guys when I say the word certificate deposit they're going to say

oh yeah CDs I remember that back in the 90s that was all the Crave the government CDs 6% they were super safe and secure right that's all [ __ ] if you look up 3-14 J UCC 3-14 J A negotiable instrument we get subsection J certificate of deposit means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and it's a promise by the bank to repay you for the sum of money that you created guess what the word is to describe this in your everyday life all

the time every single time you do anything every single day it's the word receipt right why do they ask you do you want a receipt why is the receipt re such a big thing here's your receipt do you want a receipt do you want a receipt do you want a receipt they ask you every [ __ ] time the these cashiers don't know they know they know a few buttons and they know to ask for a receipt why is why is giving a receipt that have to ask it's like they're going to die or lose their job

they don't ask you do you want a receipt do you want a receipt do you want a receipt do you want a receipt from now on when you hear that swap out the word receipt for certificate of deposit do you want a certificate of deposit do you want a certificate of deposit do you want a certificate of deposit do you want a paper instrument that contains the acknowledgement by the bank that you've created this currency called an unconditional promise to pay and deposited it in the bank showing that the Bank owes that to you at some

point in the future the godamn seat is also currency so how do we redeem that Brandon that's the question right it is currency it is currency it's an unconditional promise to pay you created an unconditional promise to pay the bank and then the bank offered you a receipt which in itself is also an unconditional promise to pay promise to pay yeah then at the end of the month they're sending you a bill which is an unconditional order to pay which is also a negotiable instrument you're abandoning all of the

unconditional promises to pay that you've manufactured throughout the whole month and then you're sending them other totally disrelated unconditional promises to pay that have nothing to do with anything it isn't even a part of your country if you're in California Utah called called Federal Reserve notes you see how crazy it is it's just nuts and it's so nuts that people won't believe it because they're full of fear and they don't want to go down the rabbit hole that you're doing it's it's

absolutely [ __ ] batshit crazy and they Bank off that yeah the number one the number one the reason why this has to be so crazy and so convoluted and so complex is because they had to take it to a point where people started saying it just can't be like this they had to once they hit that point bang they knew they had it they probably built this thing out and built this thing out and built this thing out until people started to react like that and then they're like bang we got it boys and that was it

because when you start looking at a lot of the information and a lot of the court cases that backs a lot of this information it's old man it's old old old old they stopped creating this system a long time ago brother I don't know it may even be hundreds or thousands of years old actually I think it is Mark and I were reviewing one of my old mortgage documents recently and kind of through the lens of of what you teach and uh the language in this morning mortgage was absolutely crazy so they

they said that I couldn't sign it without recourse there were like all these terms and stipulations about how I could sign it that I couldn't accept any of the of the coupons that I got that I had to pay in lawful like lawful money of the United States of America it was just this like everything you talk about was in this contract preventing me from doing that they're starting to do that um how old is your mortgage doc that was 5 years interesting because this this didn't really blow up until recently um

obviously me teaching it but uh none of that that's all irrelevant by the way um because the thing is is that um it it fraud vitiates all contracts so so all you got to do is just start talking about fraud and prove the fraud and then bang that none of that all of that falls apart right so and the other thing is too is that they can't it's just not it just they do all that and they put all that in there that that doesn't really mean anything I mean really it doesn't honestly but it just

proves proves the point that this these concepts are real and that Banks know this stuff yeah so so so recently I started digging through a lot of old Supreme Court cases because the UCC is not law at the federal level and that was really a big problem that I was trying to figure out for all this last year and so my fi finally I finally decided I'm just going to go through the uccc and I'm just going to typ in a lot of the keywords into uh uh Google Scholar and I'm just going to start

digging through old cases is to try to find where this stuff started uh rather than use the uccc um because I I just couldn't figure out what else to do so so going through a few of these cases here this one's from uh 1880 uh uh Shaw versus railroad 101 us 557 bills of exchange and promissary notes are exceptional in their character they are representatives of money circulating in the commercial world as evidence of money now keep in mind this is way back yeah there was still gold and silver

coins all the good stuff was still happening the the District of Columbia had just happened the 14th Amendment had just happened but that that didn't really push into the financial sector yet it wasn't until uh Federal Reserve Act it wasn't until the 16th Amendment it wasn't until the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 and then finally the the final killing blow to the gold standard in 1971 that's that's the bigger of the financial aspects right so at this time period 1880 we've got uh the The

Slaughterhouse Cases just happened seven years prior the District of Columbia was created uh nine years prior the uh 14th Amendment had happened uh nine years prior and uh we were just kind of recovering after the Civil War uh so so at that time period we had all these different types of currency we had gold and silver coins we had promissary notes we had bills we had everything it was all it was a big CL cluster [ __ ] everything was there right so rereading this from the beginning bills of exchange and promissary notes are

exceptional in their character they are representatives of money circulating in the commercial world as evidence of money of which any person in lawful possession May Avail himself to pay debts or make purchases or make remittances of money from one country to another or to remote places in the same country hence as said by story J uh it has become a general rule of the commercial world to hold bills of exchange as in some as in some sort sacred instrument in favor of bonafide holders for a valuable consideration

without notice hold on we're getting into too much terminology here uh let's let's skip over that because that's that's part of the flowchart we're not going to get into all that quite yet here's a a white V National Bank um uh US Supreme Court this is 18 81 uh this is talking about without recourse which is what Nick was talking about we'll get into that in the flowchart this endorsement is treated by Council here as an assignment of the paper without recourse in which the

title to the paper passed but the right to recourse to the assigner was cut off right so so these terms are not anything new here here's here's a really powerful one one of my favorites this this really this really really got me this is 1842 brother the DOR also have has the advantage of making his negotiable Securities of equivalent value to cash so so this idea that negotiable instruments are cash or can be used as cash or have essentially monetary value even though they are not money as far as

I know this is the oldest exact quote I have of that functionality in the United States of America but it it it probably goes back farther than that you know so so so we have these things that are considered cash you say cash people think cash they the the the picture that comes to my their mind is these green paper things right but the thing is is that is that cash is an unconditional promise to pay that's what it is in paper form in physical form right so we go back to the flowchart and and so we have these two

different angles the note and the and the draft and we have the flows down right so so what's happening is is that when you first create a promiser note when you first create a mortgage or you first create a uh unconditional promise to pay uh or credit card transaction you you are the maker sisser and what that means is the maker means the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer whether to a holder or non-h holder for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person so what you're

doing is you are the maker so you are when you when you give that initial instrument to the banking institution what's happening is is that you are handing it to them for the purpose of giving them the rights on the instrument and that's why they have to give you a [ __ ] receipt which is called a certificate of deposit right the term maker means a person person who signs or is identified in a note as the person undertaking to pay and people say well I only have to sometimes sign when I use my credit card

so so so the little chip inside of your credit card is is your built-in e signature that's already pre-built in and that was created based off of how you signed all your original documentation right so what they do is is they have that and then and then if you if you swipe or there's different ways you have to sign but if you stick in the chip you don't have to sign that's CU you you go on the rabbit hole what the chip is the chip is a preloaded signature based off of your original

signature when you started the account if you swipe or beep a lot of times it requires you to sign if you go to a restaurant it requires you to sign and the reason why is because the initial unconditional promise to pay is being altered because of the tip amount the tip amount Alters the document that's that's based off of uh UCC 3114 so if we go over to UCC 3114 we're going to figure this out right uh so this is really important this is like this is like pure [ __ ] power in a sentence this is like this is like if if

someone ask me if I could have 3114 as a superpower or a billion dollars in a bank account I'd rather have 3114 because this is like essentially infinite money just here by itself in a sentence essentially if an instrument contains contradictory terms typewritten terms Prevail over printed terms handwritten terms Prevail over both and words Prevail over numbers so what does that mean when you have a receipt at a restaurant there's the initial unconditional promise to pay of $50 but then what you're doing is is

you're you're handwriting the tip that tip becomes the handwritten terms so now you have to sign the document because the handwritten terms now have to be approved through some sort of endorsement or signature which is why whenever you have anything that alters the original unconditional promise to pay such as a tip there's always a signature line so you're all altering you're you're manufacturing the unconditional promise to pay altering the unconditional promise to pay which is a

security and then basically re-releasing the instrument with the signature once the tip and the total have been handwritten as terms on the face of the instrument that piece of paper that you're writing on is an instrument it is a security it is a a negotiable instrument you could take that [ __ ] down to Wall Street and sell it so we've got this basic process that you're describing now let's bring it up to some numbers that we you know that we can get our heads around like I go out

and buy a truck for 50 Grand and I take out a loan how does that affect this or are you g to get to that so we're getting into that now we're getting into the flow and the creation of these things okay got it yeah yeah so so as the maker or issuer right so so we're not going to get into all this so as the maker or issuer essentially you can't really negotiate you can't really transfer or negotiate the note you you want to become the holder the holder yeah so so the holder is the one who can

negotiate right so we're going to start getting into that right I'm going to skip over these other parts here so a holder is basically someone in position of a notor draft that is payable to them specifically or payable to Bearer so if there is no paye like on a Federal Reserve Note it's not payable to anyone but what's crazy is you can actually write pay to the order of and you can actually take a Federal Reserve Note you can actually convert it into a check which is or a draft right and there's

nothing stopping you from doing that people say well you couldn't do that with the Federal Reserve Note you absolutely can't there's absolutely no laws preventing you from doing that there's laws from defacing a Federal Reserve Note you go down the rabbit hole as what what is defacing mean it means to destroy the negotiability or value to where it can't be transferred at all like burning it would be defacing it tearing all the numbers off of it to where you can't see what the

denomination is would be defacing it writing pay to the order of and putting a a pay on it wouldn't legally be defacing the the note at all it's negotiating the note as the holder all sorts of crazy [ __ ] you can do with the Federal Reserve Note my brother so so uh whenever you receive a Federal Reserve Note I don't have any uh here's here's a couple right here I have these I collect I collect all sorts of crazy [ __ ] I got old bearer bonds Confederate bearer bonds from back in

the Confederate War I've got I've got gold backs which are these cool kind of new currencies I've got a buddy of mine who creates his own silver coins special silver coins based off of different things I've got a gold coin someone sent me for a consultation they wanted to pay me in Gold so they sent me a gold gold buffalo coin I've got silver certificates over here I've got $2 bills I've got I'm a I'm a A Member of Parliament for a micronation called uh uh slaman they've got slaman duales I've

got these I've got all sorts of crazy [ __ ] right but I also think $2 bills are really cool so I have a $2 uh a $2 Federal Reserve Note here and uh if we take a look at it you'll see here it doesn't have it's not payable to any specific person which we're going to get into endorsements here in just a moment right and actually I found the law recently that states that it's not that you're actually when they issue them they have to be issued payable to the bearer they can't issue them with a

special endorsement but you as the holder I'm the holder of this right now I can actually write anything I want on it and 3114 states that anything I hand write on this becomes the new terms and overwrites the typewritten terms as long as I don't def face the instrument I can negotiate the instrument however I want and that gets really interesting if I put pay to the order of Mark I don't know how to pronounce your last name Yi and and somehow it gets to Nick and Nick tries to take it and use

it I could actually he'll never it'll never work it'll never get through the courts but I could actually Sue Nick for illegally negotiating the instrument which is like up to 25 years in prison it'll never go anywhere but I'm just saying technically you can do [ __ ] like that once you understand how negotiable instruments work and if you think the SEC knows anything about anything I'm teaching you guys absolutely not all the way from the president all the way down to the people pushing the papers nobody

in the SEC knows anything about any of this so yeah you think the SEC is gonna come they don't know anything about any you don't need to worry about any of these [ __ ] agencies they don't know a goddamn thing about any of this [ __ ] the treasury doesn't know a [ __ ] thing about any of this I I don't even think Janet Yellen knows anything about any of this thank God she's gone yeah Brandon I have heard that the IRS is a aware that when you sign your IRS bills in a certain way

that that they will erase your de you know that'll the IRS the IRS is pretty good at all this stuff I just sent them they just sent me a bunch of bills I sent them all back I did all this stuff that you're seeing all the stuff it was probably somewhere in the ballpark of it was three bills it probably somewhere in the ballpark of like six or seven Grand it was from like 2018 2019 2020 type stuff sent it allll back not a peep not a [ __ ] peep special endorsement kind of thing special qualified endorsement yep

special and qualified yep with a cute little cover letter the whole thing right so so I haven't heard a peep no more bills nothing so you know I sent those off I think they signed for those like November 30th so it's been uh it's been it's been plenty of time to get a respon and and like we started off with silence is acquiescence right so if you don't hear from them that's good news yeah and a lot of people kind of freak out about that they they want something in return they want some kind of a

receipt or something um and uh the thing is is that if you think about what is a receipt right you when you when they send you a bill they're actually the maker sisser and then when you receive the bill you become the holder of of that instrument and then we're going to get into endorsements when you endorse the instrument and tender the instrument back to the person entitled to enforce the instrument you're sort of completing the cycle like for them to send you a receipt a receipt would mean that you

deposited an unconditional promise to pay that was an overpayment and they need to give you a certificate of deposit because you overpaid but if you if you endorse the bill and send it back it's a zero at the end of that they would they wouldn't give you a receipt for a zero What's the definition of a receipt let's go back and look at it again 3-14 subsection J is the definition of a receipt and I know it's a lot of information you got to go over it over and over again you're not going to no

one on the [ __ ] planet it's going to understand you this [ __ ] watching a show one time never going to happen it's never happened and it never will happen Okay so don't get worried about that certificate of deposit means an instrument containing an acknowledgement by a bank that a sum of money which is hilarious they say none of this has anything to do with money and then they go off and use the word money which also [ __ ] hilarious so even within this [ __ ] if I was in litigation I'd bring up

[ __ ] like that and start banging I mean none of these none of these attorneys know even a 1,000th of any of this to even get that far into the conversation but if you did you could bang him with that too right uh acknowledgement by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money a certificate of deposit is a note of the bank so why the [ __ ] would they give you one of these you didn't overpay if you overpaid they would have to give you a

certificate of deposit you didn't overpay you zeroed they said they they sent you $700 and you sent back $700 it's zero so there wouldn't be any receipt or certificate of deposit that the IRS would produce and send back to you as regards to that payment and no one knows the definition of the word payment we have to clear that up too but let's just move forward into the definition of the word payment okay it means the performance of a Duty promise or obligation so what's happening is is

that the the the the the IRS is manufacturing a draft which is an unconditional order to pay they're sending you that draft you become the holder and then at that point you can just simply endorse that negotiable instrument because it has the full value of the face value of whatever they're ordering you to pay and then send it back and it's legally a payment because you've now performed on a duty promise or obligation and for those of you that are out there wondering how in the here's if

there's anybody out there right now saying where the [ __ ] did this come from yeah fantastic those are my people you're my people you're my people the answer to that question is the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 y we're not going to get into that right now um I can give you uh just one little touch uh Congress was speaking about it and there's one part in the Congressional Record where they do a really good job of EXP explaining it in like a paragraph and I'll go ahead and

just give you that and then from there if you want to dig into the 9 billion aspects of it you can so here is the original House Congressional Record during the gold abreg act in 1933 when they swapped all this over and they converted this system over to the new system now this is an exact word for word duplicate meaning meaning there's certain capitalized words the word Nation the word government they're capitalized this word is NOT capitalized every sing single period every single space is an exact duplicate from the

Congressional Record because I wanted to have a perfect duplicate so here's the quote under the new law the money is issued to the banks in return for government obligations bills of exchange drafts notes trade acceptances and bankers acceptances the money will be worth 100 cents on the dollar which they don't know what any of that means obviously because it is backed by the credit of the nation now here's where it gets creepy this last sentence is where things get creepy it will represent a mortgage on

all the homes and other property of all the people in the nation that's nuts right there right then we're going to go into they use the word obligation so I went on a deep dive to try to find more information about that hn usa8 obligation or other security of the United States to find the term obligation or other security of the United States includes all bonds all certificates of indebtedness all National Bank currency all Federal Reserve notes all Federal Reserve Bank notes all coupons all United States

notes all treasury notes all gold certificates all silver certificates all fractional notes all certificates of deposit all bills all checks all drafts everything and you say to yourself well hold on a second does that mean that the my my utility bill is my bill or is it the United States's bill it's the United States's Bill sure is that's why your name's in all capital letters it ain't you it's a so proprietorship who Soul proprietor you didn't even make the [ __ ] thing you

didn't even make you don't even know this thing showed up you don't even know when this [ __ ] thing came into your life you don't know anything about it how so it's not yours so all these bills and drafts and all these things you're you're the authorized signature the goddamn bank account checks tell you you're the [ __ ] authorized signature so if a goddamn [ __ ] bill comes to you and it's got that name of that business that you didn't even know you had that you didn't even know where

it came from how the [ __ ] could it be yours brand I just had a click if you're if you work for Starbucks and you order the beans in you're not person person Al paying for the beans of Starbucks right the company is so if you're an employee of the United States and the sole proprietor and you have a bill the the federal government pays for it that's what this that's their obligation right we should all have credit cards and they should all have infinite credit on them and and ever since 1933 that's the way

this thing supposed to be set up you've got the self proprietorship and then through the sub proprietorship you should have like a [ __ ] MX Centurion black card with infinite credit on it that's really what we're supposed to have and that's why if you start looking at the freedom uh uh uh the the credit acts and stuff about credit look up court cases where people file lawsuits against the credit uh agencies for denying them credit based off of discrimination they always win you can have infinite money you just

you just you just get a bunch of loans you don't pay any of them quote unquote pay that's [ __ ] anyways you already did pay them you paid them when you opened them you get all these [ __ ] credit cards and mortgages don't quotee unquote pay any of them you already did you just didn't know it let them all default let them all go on your credit sue the credit company for for uh uh for discrimination make money because they defamed you and harmed you get all that removed off your credit repeat the

cycle infinite money there's a lot of ways to infinite money my friend okay now if we go to this gets crazier 31 USC oh I've got to memorize this I've got to memorize it oh it's so important 1501 oh I've got a memor oh 1501 yes got it 31 USC 1501 check this out bro I found this recently oh man I started plugging these into my cases so [ __ ] fast my pens ripped in half an amount shall be recorded as an obligation of the the United States government only when it is supported by documentary evidence

of look at number two a loan agreement showing the amount and terms of repayment wow Bank of America sued you because you didn't pay on your mortgage here's your response uh uh I hereby motion the court to add in a new a new uh a new plaintiff or new defendant uh the United States government and you're going to add the United States government as a defendant into the case and you're going to attach evidence showing that your mortgage document is in fact a loan agreement showing the amount and terms of

repayment and the responsible party to perform on that mortgage documentation is actually the United States government it's an obligation of the United States government under 18 usca obligation or other security of the United States to find bam there's there it ain't your [ __ ] money Bill Bill yeah it ain't your [ __ ] bill nobody in in either country because it's it's weird because they've taken over all the other countries they've taken over California and everything so

these countries are gone technically speaking in California everything I'm teaching you doesn't exist all this stuff we've already seen article 4 section 35 and 36 or whatever it was we've already seen all of this is illegal in California in state of California it's completely legal they are not directly taxing you at all that would be unconstitutional so do they you they were kind enough to give you a business business happens to have the same name as you they tax that thing you

think it's you that's the issue there's nothing unconstitutional about taxing a business it's called an excise tax and if you go down the rabbit hole of that one the entire 16th Amendment is only talking about excise taxes and how does the FED window fit into this well we we we Let's uh let's hold off on that one for a minute so so so you become the holder of a note or draft and then at that point now you can do what's called negotiation this is where negotiation actually takes place means a

transfer of possession whether voluntary or involuntary of an instrument by a person other let's not get into that last part so it's transfer negotiation is transfer so so how does transfer occur it occurs through what's called an endorsement which is a long definition uh uh endorsement I'm going to I'm going to make this simple it's [ __ ] written on the goddamn thing to to that basically are the the instructions or laws associated with how it can be transferred redeemed or uh or or

exchanged that's it so for example let's go back to the the Czech example um I should just leave this thing up where' it go oh here it is here's our check we lost it um here's our check here okay so so people so so let's give some examples here okay so so we're going to we're going to create this check we're going to be the maker of the issuer uh uh but but for the sake of Simplicity we're also going to say we're kind of like negotiating the check as well okay so

negotiation means we're we're writing the rules as to who can redeem or transfer or how this thing can move we're we're we're we're writing the because pay to the order of if I write uh a mark Yi on there can can Nicholas go and and and cash it not unless I endorse it well yeah that's what I'm that's what I'm saying so so it's the rule it's the rules of transfer you're writing the rules of transfer here PID to the order of now now let's say this is blank

blank check people have heard of that what is a blank check well it's the same thing is saying blank endorsement it's actually Lally the same terminology blank endorsement does not State the paye and automatically makes the instrument payable to Bearer people feel bad they they get a blank check and then they write their name on it and they did I do something illegal you didn't even need to put your [ __ ] name on it at all you could you could scoot it now the teller might not know this but a a a seasoned Banker

would know if the goddamn thing is signed and there's no [ __ ] name on it it's cash yeah it's a bearer Bond it's a bearer Bond it doesn't need to have a name on it okay uh uh another way another way that you can make it really really clear that this is Cash is you can write the word Bearer paid to the order of Bearer blank endorsement does not say the paye or it states the paye explicitly as payable to the bearer it would still have the same effect payable to Bearer you could write

in here Bearer payable to Bearer nothing all of those would be blank checks you're creating cash you are manufacturing cash put the date here $20 $20 sign it don't put a paye here you've just manufact factured legal cash that can move from person to person to person just like this forever until someone makes it payable to themselves or something or goes to the Federal Reserve discount window and does something else with it it's a security that can travel through the the culture just like a

Federal Reserve Note Forever This is it's it's a Federal Reserve Note it's the same [ __ ] thing there there is no paye on it now a special endorsement States the paye Mark yui Nicholas spone Brandon Joe Williams uh now keep in mind Starbucks is a person Starbucks Inc Starbucks Inc is a person so you write you write uh uh uh Roofing uh uh uh best roofers Los Angeles it's a person you can write a that's a special endorsed instrument States the paye who is a person called great roofs Los Angeles or

whatever and then you have all these different types of endorsements uh there's a bunch of other ones I don't even have here that almost nobody ever uses so I didn't even list them but you have here a qualified endorsement is just really really simple and when you guys start going down this whole investment uh endorsement Rabbit Hole you're going to find it's a lot of information you can see even from this definition over here they try to make it really really complicated so people

don't look at it because this is like this is like the hottest of the hottest of the hottest like when you understand how to endorse you never have to [ __ ] pay a bill with Federal Reserve notes ever again it's it it just never has to happen uh all bills pay for themselves how do they pay for themselves by you performing on a duty obligation or contract the definition of payment how do you perform on a duty obligation or contract by accepting the bill becoming the holder of the bill endorsing the

bill and then negotiating or transferring or tendering that bill back to who is called the person entitled to enforce the bill which completes the cycle how did this cycle get started the 1933 Emergency Banking Act and how all the money was going to be converted into a mortgage that represented all the property in the nation and all this that you saw earlier from the Congressional Record okay so we live in this world where there is no there is no debt there is no nothing they send you this thing

you're supposed to do some stuff with it and then send it back and that's considered payment that's considered performance performance and payment mean the same thing and this works for traffic tickets this works for anything you get the traffic ticket the traffic ticket is an unconditional promise to pay you indorse the unconditional promise to pay and you mail it back to whoever's going to process that that payment there's so many people teaching how to sign and and like it just most of it doesn't make

sense and so Brandon when I when I got your contract killer course or I went through that and I really understood how to sign as you know buy Nicholas spone on behalf or on behalf of Nicholas bone in all caps by Nicholas bone comma agenta agent without recourse and I sign everything like that now and it's and what you teach is all based on the UCC yeah there's a lot of people teaching a lot of dumb [ __ ] I mean I was into all that dumb [ __ ] at the beginning too uh I probably even taught some of it uh years

ago and then and then and then as I got deeper and deeper and as I realized UCC was sort of like the Bible of all this I kind of threw all that out like for example uh uh a for V accepted for Value that's consider this whole process that you can find all over the Internet um the thing is when you start reading ucc3 you realize that accepted for Value just means that you didn't you you never specified that you were only taking part of the instrument if you never specified that you're taking part of the instrument

only and leaving other parts or like if there's multiple owners of an instrument you wouldn't say accepted for Value because it's accepted multiple people are accepting it so there's a certain percentage of value going to each of the individual people that are accepting it but that's almost I mean unless you're in some kind of like deep weird banking related situation you're never going to see that right so by simply receiving a bill because if you look at the legal definition of the word accepted means

accepted by delivery if you receive a bill by delivery you've accepted it for Value it's not a [ __ ] process it's the stupidest [ __ ] thing in the world it's like someone took one small little part of ucc3 and made this whole process out of it it doesn't make any sense if you if you go to your mailbox and you pull out of your mailbox a bill and you have it in your hand you've accepted the bill for value now you open up that bill and you look at it you're the holder

now now you're going to negotiate the bill through an endorsement which as per UCC 3114 you could just write on the face of the goddamn thing with a pen that's why I told you if I if I could choose between a billion dollars and 3114 I'd choose 3114 because if an instrument contains contradictory terms typewritten terms Prevail over printed terms handwritten terms Prevail over both handwritten terms they printed a bill that says you owe them you you owe them money or whatever currency and you've handwritten

terms on the face of the bill saying you don't which one wins the handwritten terms always win always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always win what do you do and how do you do this and what do you write and all this you're it's andwritten terms once you understand the contract and you understand how all this works and you understand how the exchange functions and you understand that it's all the United States [ __ ]

anyways it it becomes uh simpler because the emotion start to get out of it you know you want to get the emotions out of it as fast as you can I think the 18 USC 8 and the and the 31 USC 15351 I think that's pretty cool because it it pulls a lot of the emotion out of it is isn't even your [ __ ] at all chances are you you've never gotten a bill in your whole life maybe depending on where you live I mean if some local plumber comes and and and fixes your plumbing and he just got some [ __ ]

print off whatever or handwritten bill I'd say that was probably uh a bill that was for you because he doesn't know any of this he's not going to go and do any of these things but any big huge company that's why it has the barcode on it it's got all these strings and numbers it's got the coupon it's got you got to think like there's all these strings and numbers there's like two [ __ ] barcodes on your bills one at the top and one at the bottom there's string of

number here there's like a little four string a little five string a little six string up here and on the bottom on the coupon there's a bunch of larger strings that look almost like routing in account numbers and and I haven't gone completely down this Rabbit Hole I would say there probably are routing in account numbers now we start getting into uh uh routing from where to where what account is this who is it and why the [ __ ] is it on my voucher that'll get your cases dismissed

real [ __ ] fast right they don't want to answer those questions so so what the [ __ ] are these things what the [ __ ] are these that's why they want you want the auto autopay they don't want you looking at these things yeah that's why they want you not using cash they don't want you looking at this thing and being like payable to the bear how interesting legal tender this note is legal tender for all debts public and private interesting what is legal tender what is public and private what is this two

signatures on here what is there two signatures on here looks like Bond paper the way that the outsides have that kind of bond paper you know they don't want people doing that yeah so they you know so what do they do they give you your 1% cash back on your credit card while they steal all of the produced currency that you're manufacturing throughout the month by creating all these unconditional promises to pay and basically they they consider you just abandoning all of them and they've

already gotten paid well they've already gotten paid at the end of the month the the all yeah so so so when you put the credit card into the the credit card into the credit card reader it instantaneously zeros out the account yeah it's a $2 it's a $2 charge you promise to pay $2 the promise to pay is a negotiable instrument that can be used to discharge the original obligation all they got to do is just put two and two together Bing and they get a zero they just don't do that right I used to wonder how credit

cards could offer 0% interest rates for you know 18 months well you get your credit card you put a $20,000 charge on it they're taking that to the Federal Reserve window to create the funds for that charge so they're not they're not actually lending you any of their reserves there's no reserves right no God no they don't need it we'll get into the window in a second we have to understand negotiation and endorsements really thoroughly before we can get to the window stuff so just let me go a little

farther on this then we have the window okay so so without recourse is really important it's a type of endorsement called a qualified endorsement right uh it it it it's it's crazy it's absolutely crazy crazy in financial transactions without recourse disclaims any liability to the subsequent holder of a financial instrument so adding without recourse to the signature means that the endorser the person creating or signing takes no responsibility if the check bounces so what does that

mean you can write a check for $200,000 and you've only got $5 in your bank account if you write without re course on the check when you issue it it's a it's a $200,000 payment basically good good luck good luck trying to get that to the courts though yeah right uh I I'm I'm trying to do these kinds of things in the courts and basically uh I can't tell if they think I'm either crazy or they're pretending to think that I'm crazy because they know that if they allow this

through the entire economy it's just going to explode in in I i' I've read those cases uh Brandon I think they're pretending to make you crazy yeah I think they're pretending as well they're doing The Sovereign citizen [ __ ] on you and all this other stuff calling you wacko so it's it's an interesting now now you got to think from their perspective they're in a precarious situation yeah because if they allow these very very lawful things that I am doing to go through the court

system especially with how big my platform is it's humongous yeah the whole this whole country is going to explode in about 24 hours it's going to create a precedent everybody will quote the precedent and that's it game over I mean uh so so while I do have some empathy towards their precarious situation I really don't at the end of the day right because the banks are stealing everyone it's literally The Matrix we're all these walking pods manufacturing all this energy and they're just taking

it and then they they they they can they they justify it by saying we're abandoning it how can you abandoning abandon something you never even knew you [ __ ] made in the first place yeah you mean to tell me oh if people knew that they were manufacturing all their own currency and everything was a zero as soon as they Ed their credit card you think they'd still be sending in Federal Reserve notes the [ __ ] doesn't make any sense so like so like as part of the letter of the law all this is legal but like they would

never want any of this to get in front of a jury do you think a jury would think this is okay I don't care if it's black if it's women if it's white if it's Asian if it's yellow if it's this I don't care what the [ __ ] the jury is I don't care what they could have an IQ of 60 they could be it could be people with Down syndrome and they'll you could probably get a [ __ ] conviction on some [ __ ] like this if they've ever paid a bill they're gonna side with you so the thing

is is that is that The Closer you get to a jury with all this information that that's a slam dunk you get in front of a jury it's over the thing is they they they from my experience I'm experiencing it as we speak and you can look at my cases they go absolutely batshit I mean if this thing gets even one yard close to you know if it gets down the one yard line uh toward a jury they're going to have an ape [ __ ] they're going to go ape [ __ ] so um I don't see any any other option

so I'm just going to keep doing it until something happens uh this is the law this is honest this is the truth I'm trying to perform everything I'm doing is within the confines of the law entirely uh in fact uh uh the the life that I live is is way more lawful and legal than the life that I lived previously uh I'm probably one of the cleanest squeakiest [ __ ] walking the the planet uh walking these two countries uh these 49 countries excuse me so um the it's it's a it's a uh uh you

know it's an interesting situation to say the least so getting back to without recourse without recourse means [ __ ] you [ __ ] you literally it's like writing [ __ ] you on the on the on the instrument basically I mean honestly really um you don't need to pay you you don't need to do [ __ ] [ __ ] you if it doesn't clear it still it still counts as a payment I don't give a [ __ ] without recourses this seriously the most badass [ __ ] ever you know if I had to chewed between without recourse and a billion

dollars give me without recourse without recourses infinite money by itself okay so so now you're going to get this thing right you're going to get this thing you're going to become the holder and then now when you become the holder you're going to start endorsing these things now now where did I learn all this where did you learn all this Brandon how did you get tipped off to this we started I started having my followers go out and get copies of the mortgages and [ __ ] and I started finding

all this terminology on the goddamn mortgage documents that's how this whole thing got started so here's a bunch of mortgage documents without recourse paid to the order of Rocket mortgage LLC AKA or FKA whatever that means quick and Loans LLC by signature of a person's name and the name of person Stephanie beavers capture manager this is what tip me off to all this is how this this was how I figured all this out right pay to the order of countrywide Home Loans Inc without recourse Countrywide document custody

Services a division of Treasury Bank NA by signature of a of a person Lori Meer vice president and then it got transferred again see it got transferred once and it got transferred again 3-14 handwritten or typed terms Prevail over so what they're doing is they're writing handwritten or typed endorsements just like a check on the face of the instrument transferring the instrument to a different person or part and then that party is then transferring it to another party so like you've heard

about this like in the first 60 days they usually sell your mortgage yes this is what's happening they're endorsing the mortgage just like this and then transferring it over to a new holder right yep Brandon what are you finding is happening with people getting mortgages and signing it without recourse well we'll get into that in just a second okay okay without recourse pay to the order of quick and Loans LLC this one's by Erica Monique Hill capture manager pay to the order of PHH Mortgage Corporation

without recourse so when it's pay to the order of if it states the paye it's a special endorsement so the original note when you signed it was blank endorsed and then now you you you're you're issuing it to them and then they're taking it and they're making it pay payable to themselves and they're making it payable to themselves in a way where they basically whoever they're transferring it to they never have to pay it back without recourse so okay okay we're starting to

we're starting to get hot on the trail of how this thing works this [ __ ] scam without recourse pay to the order of homebridge Financial Services Inc DBA real estate mortgage Network Carly Francis assistant secretary now just just by the way if anyone would like uh to get copies of all this and see this for yourself shockingly they'll give it to you they're going to file for a freedom of information request or or a um or the state version of that whichever one is the one that they want

and you're going to request a copy of the processed original notes that have any uh uh Pro uh uh endorsements or Ales associated with them and a is an attached sheet of paper that's used this is a good example right here a to note it's it's attached to a note or bill because there wasn't enough room to write all of the endorsement information so an alange is an attached sheet of paper that contains the endorsement information because the original document or negotiable instrument did

not have enough room on it uh uh uh for the endorsement mhm it's to create additional room right so you're going to ask your lender they aren't your lender they're a currency exchange you're going to ask your currency exchange which they'll call themselves A lender it's fraud uh it's a currency exchange you're going to ask your currency exchange to get copies of your original note uh and it has to as part of your request it has to have any uh endorsements or Ales

with it and and they're starting to catch on to the fact that we're catching on to this so we'll see if they uh freak out they have to send it to you they don't have a choice uh if they don't then you sue them and tell the court that you don't have a loan you asked for the loan you don't have it you don't remember signing anything and then make make them submit it into the court case right but the thing is is it it's a uh uh so so so what are they doing with all of these

this is where things get crazy so what they're doing is they're going to what's called the Federal Reserve discount window we're going to go to 12 USC 412 we're going to find out how does that work uh uh you can write up an application for notes such application for notes Federal Reserve notes shall be accompanied with a tender to the local Federal Reserve agent of collateral in amount equal to the sum of the Federal Reserve notes thus applied for the collateral security thus offered

shall be no notes drafts bills of exchange or acceptances blah blah blah BL blah so what's happening is they're going to the Federal Reserve discount window FB discount window. G and they're writing up an application for notes to swap that original promiser note that you signed here for Federal Reserve Reserve notes and people always think okay so they're basically getting a loan on on that original document basically correct that's what they're doing the problem is is that when they write without recourse

on the [ __ ] endorsement they don't ever have to pay back the Federal Reserve such a scam so they're turning around You released this note with a blank endorsement they're turning around putting a qualifying and special endorsement on it going to the Federal Reserve discount window swapping it for Federal Reserve notes free and clear they never need to pay it back and then they turn around and they hand you basically your own notes that you are the one that created because the definition of the individual who

actually has the credit is the person who's able to promise to pay the bank never promised to pay you did so who has the credit you do so what did they do they subverted your credit got you to manufacture currency release that currency without any uh stipulation they got their hands on this currency and then the way that they fund quote unquote your quote unquote loan just in loan is they turn around without recourse they get the free cash the free Federal Reserve notes they convert this into Federal Reserve notes turn around

and hand you your own Federal Reserve notes at interest and that's so they get paid twice essentially if they they get paid twice and and and as far as I know the value of the original note is the maturity value of the note so 30-year mortgage at 4% when they go to the window if you're buying an $800,000 house they go to the window they come back with 1.4 million doll yeah they give you the 800 for your house they pocket 600 and you still owe him the full 800 yeah it's unbelievable actually and that's how this whole it's

brilliant actually it's brilliant really and you got and you got to ask yourself and you got to ask yourself one question here's the question all these I I have a few really important key questions I like to have people ask to really th this is what jumpstarts the Curiosity that you need to start digging into all this the question is this how the [ __ ] do the banks own own everything they own everything yeah it wasn't like that in the 50s and 60s and 70s how in 30 or 40 years did the banks

own everything my initial answer would be we went off the gold standard in 71 but I don't but the the answer to your to the question is this is the answer because of this because of this yeah there's no risk everything's owned all these loans quote unquote have the house as collateral so they're getting 1.4 million UPF front and then if you don't diligently pay every [ __ ] payment for 30 years they'll take the house they take the whole house back so you you you you paid 400,000 you

paid for 15 years and then you can't pay anymore they take the whole house back through a foreclosure and then what do they do they turn around and they do this exact same process again they can't lose they can't lose in 40 years they own everything amazing so just to wrap up this flowchart so how do you how do you how do you handle all this this this is the Kryptonite this is the bank Kryptonite you do the same [ __ ] thing you have them you have them send you a payoff sheet hi I need a payoff

sheet for my entire loan you write without recourse pay to the order of whoever or payable to Bearer or payable to them who who do I make the check out to you ask them and you just hand write on the face of the bill without recourse paid to the order of whoever they say to pay by my name and then below that put man or whatever that's how they do it tender it back to the person entirely enforce the instrument now at that point they they have they have two choices they think they have three they think

they can ignore you they can't they they legally they have two choices choice number one is they're they have to now apply that as a payment because you've completed the cycle the second choice is they can dishonor the instrument UCC 3-h um oh boy don't fart on me now Brandon 505 503 uh 502 bam 502 uh 503 that was 503 it's 502 let's go back 502 502 dishonor so there are certain rules as to how they can dishonor a note or draft there's rules for notes up top and then you go down to subsection B it's notes

for drafts so so if you're getting a draft from them which is going to be your payoff sheet these are the rules associated with dishonor most of them involve time like the payoff sheet was only good for 10 days but you mailed in the payoff sheet past that 10 days but 3-14 says that you can just write on the [ __ ] bill and whatever you write become the new rules so you cross out where it says 10 days and you write payable on demand now they can't dishonor it you see whatever you write on the goddamn thing

becomes the new [ __ ] terms of the agreement on the instrument but isn't their dishonor if they don't accept your payment no no no I'm talking about this is like the legal [ __ ] I'm talking about like this is the way they can actually legally refuse it got okay okay the word dishonor in English means this is how they can legally refuse it these are the only ways they can Le people think oh they can just ignore you or nope these are the rules governing how they can refuse these are the only ways that they can

refuse there are no it's it's B1 B2 B3 or B4 uh uh sir I okay you're wasting my time are you dishonoring this instrument under uh UCC 3- 502 subsection B1 subsection B2 subsection B3 or subsection B4 uh sir we shut the [ __ ] up I'm gonna ask you the question again are you dishonoring this instrument under UCC 5-52 under subsection B1 subsection B2 subsection B3 or subsection B4 if they don't answer the question now you can start beating the [ __ ] out of them how does that work it's really simple

so now if they fail to to dishonor the instrument which is legally how they can refuse the instrument and they fail this is failure you need to use the term failure they are failing to perform if they fail to perform by dishonoring the instrument legally and they failed to perform by applying the pay the the the the the instrument as a payment now we're going to get into litigation what what are what does ucc3 say that you should be doing in that in that e legal unlawful situation well the easiest spot to get

the answer to that is 3- 603 subsection B if tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to the person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused now keep in mind what was the term the use before for a legal refusal it's the word uh um uh the one I just said a million times what is it uh dishonor dishonor so dishonor means legal refusal refused means illegal refusal there is discharge to the extent of the amount of the tender the godamn payment applies either

way if you send me a bill a payoff sheet for a $30 million home and I endorse it and send it back to you and you don't legally dishonor the instrument it's a payment whether you [ __ ] like it or not [ __ ] it makes no difference it is a payment if you don't apply it as a payment you're just a dumbass it's illegal I'm going to sue you you will be applying it as a payment because you don't have a [ __ ] Choice yes and tender payment and performance all mean the same thing correct yeah uh

no tender means an unconditional offer so so so so if I if I extend this $2 bill to you like this and there's no conditions attached if I say hey if you give me an invoice I'll give this to you wouldn't be a tender tender is just here here is my offer in performance without any conditions or stipulations at all whatsoever so if I extend uh this this is where things get interesting if I if I try to pay with these gold backs right I'm gonna pay with these gold backs so here here's me I'm the uh I'm

I'm the they say negotiable instrument on them because they they went through all this litigation these are not negotiable instruments that's complete horseshit and all the [ __ ] lawyers and all the [ __ ] attorneys and all the [ __ ] judges associated with their Ro dumbass [ __ ] these are not negotiable instruments uh they're not unconditionally promising or ordering anything stupidest [ __ ] thing in the world they had to do that because they got sued and banking industry going crazy and everything else these These

are actually uh these actually would be considered money um it's a bit outside of the definition but but it's close enough to where I I would give it to him this is actually money right so let's say let's say let's say you you came to my house and you uh uh fixed my sink and I'm going to give you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 uh uh single uh gold backs which is one 1000th of a troy ounce of 24 karat gold okay and I go like and I have them here this wouldn't be tender yet this is

now tender here you go once I've extended and offered this as performance right uh uh performance doesn't need to be monetary if I if I uh uh offer to in exchange uh uh wash your clothes that actually would would actually legally be considered tender as well you're tendering performance you're offering performance now if we go back to at the beginning of the show we have consideration now the other party has to make a determination is this adequate consideration that's the beauty of the

banks and a lot of the industries and the and the governments the governments have to follow all this [ __ ] UCC crap they don't have a [ __ ] choice they have to follow all this [ __ ] but when it's you and your buddy and you're just [ __ ] around and throwing [ __ ] around it's it's contract based it's based off of consideration it it's it's just a it's all consideration It all becomes just this like completely open market that's just only consideration based not statute

based the banks and the big conglomerates and Starbucks and all these organizations they don't have that they don't have that luxury because they voluntarily created this stupid ass [ __ ] Corporation they volunteered to do all these things they identified with the so Proprietors ship they're in all this [ __ ] they don't have that option they don't have that choice and that's why law seems insane because they follow these things like law they don't follow consideration in all these kinds

of things I mean those kind of things can become involved in the conversation but the conversation becomes really complex because you can write up a [ __ ] promissary note on a sheet of paper and hand it to the [ __ ] teller and she laughs and thinks you're crazy you videotape the whole thing and then you sue Starbucks Incorporated for failing to accept and perform on an instrument a legal instrument you can't do that outside of the statutory system so like for all the people that are watching if you have companies and

corporations and businesses that are plugged into all this my people are probably going to come for you at some point and the whole reason why we're doing this the whole reason why we're gangas KH scor Earth because when people wake up to all this crazy [ __ ] they're going to do what exit the system that's how we win yeah if I go around gangas conning everybody but at the same time turning around and teaching everyone how to get out of it and never have it happen again and also make a whole bunch of money on

the back end to to where like the crazy [ __ ] that I did to you doesn't even [ __ ] matter anymore I win all my people are going to win we're all fat Hogs making billions of dollars [ __ ] scorched Earth while at the same time freeing everyone from the Matrix and that's basically my whole platform in a nutshell essentially people think that what we're doing is is is dishonest no what's dishonest is every time you [ __ ] use your credit card your manufacturing currency that the bank assumes you're

abandoning you are you are a walking slave producing currency for the bank and the bank is carefully making sure you never find out that's that's the evil part I am taking advantage of the system because I understand it and I'm teaching the system to others people think that's dishonest that's not if you think what I'm doing is more dishonest than what the banks are doing you have a seriously [ __ ] up moral compass well there's a lot of [ __ ] up moral compasses these days anyway but uh

what I think you're doing is is I mean you've been able to walk through in the last what four and a half hours you know a very logical progression of what happens and you've got laws and codes and things to back you up and so how can anybody look at it and really say it's dishonest unless they are the ones that don't understand so um you know I appreciate your time your wisdom the amount of work you put into this to cogently you know walk through it I don't know how the heck you

could convince a courtroom or a jury unless you unless they give you the four hours to do this but it's all there if they're willing to listen they're willing to learn it's all there I me look at uh like for example people don't people don't realize uh like look at uh uh like a John Wayne gasy Case or an OJ case you know you think to yourself oh cut and dry super easy no problem I think the John Wayne gasy Case uh it took him a year to prepare for trial uh so so so so so you know people

think all these things about courts it's just all craziness you she go out and watched some of these new documentaries coming out there's a couple good ones about the OJ trial that just came out really cool the OJ trial went on for a [ __ ] year and these people were sequestered the goddamn jury was sequestered they were they were they were in the the [ __ ] trial in a [ __ ] thing not able to talk to anyone living in a hotel not able to do [ __ ] not even able to [ __ ] watch the media

I think they were told don't even watch the media there too much craziness and it'll [ __ ] up the case for a goddamn year nice justice system man and then at the end of the year and people are asking the jury members and a lot of them if you if you watch these document they were like dude we just wanted it to be over bro yeah we just wanted it to end you know what I mean so so so you know you have six months to a year to prepare and then a year trial you know you're talking about four hours of

work I mean I mean you could do you could you could present a six months worth the [ __ ] at a trial if you wanted to if if they'll let you yeah but I'm just saying I'm just saying you know four and a half hours is is nothing yeah yeah yeah well I I want to thank you for your time and wisdom Nick do you have any parting comments for uh for Brandon questions yeah we've had a blast Mark and I tend to kind of synchronize and go deep on different topics and so we had a lot of fun going through your Contract

Killers course and messaging back and forth about hey did you read this UCC and did you check out this video and and so I would encourage anybody listening to this to definitely go get that course and uh and check out your websites and uh like I said we've had a ton of fun learning about it and having you on and it's uh it's been a blast what do your uh what do your clients think about all this uh Mark it's crazy well most of them just laugh think and think I'm crazy yeah and if they know me

they know I'm a little crazy but you it's it's really hard to explain unless you actually do the steps right you have to just define the definition you have to show what dishonor is show what an endorsement is show all these things and still they're brainwashed it's so hard to break through that yeah but once you can show them some stuff and they see the light at the end of the tunnel and they realize based on the last five years of the [ __ ] we've been getting anyway right on all the other stuff that

you can't believe anything anyway so you might as well try to believe something that's got some law behind it then they start to listen a little bit right so you know I think it's I think it's a it's fascinating and I think it's a movement and I'm I you know Nick and I talk about you know telling other people and trying to spread the word but not everybody's ready you know and the people that are ready are going to be able to to be at the top of the pyramid oh yeah and I think I think if your

demographics older guys with money you know you might be kind of cushy you might be kind of wanting to retire whatever but the thing is is that you know uh in that same book Leading Edge of Boomers and seniors uh from Dan S Kennedy one of the things he talks about is um the the female Leading Edge Boomers in senior demographic uh their number one concern as they move into that 60 65 plus age range becomes charity I'm talking about women not men yeah uh uh uh 70% uh uh from his research uh as women

become more successful as women the the wives of men who are successful so so let's say you have a a couple very wealthy very to well Todo and and you have the husband you have the wife and they have no Financial issues the wife statistically is the one who's going to be trying to figure out charity uh uh local activities uh uh female empowerment uh uh groups social groups these kind of things become a a a top of the concern for a woman in that kind of age range and that kind of so the thing

is is that you know even if even if you're not looking at this information I don't look at this information from from a point of view of personal gain I did at the very beginning because I had an issue I was trying to deal with with the Employment Development Department who I ended up spanking out here in California uh but but the thing is that this is so much bigger than just making some money or getting some free things and and I and I tantalize people with a lot of that because people are so [ __ ]

degraded and they and they've got the shitty car and the shitty life and the shitty apartment and just just just giving them something cool is really exciting and it kind of boosts it's a big booster uh but but once you have a decent place to live and a decent car and a couple other things you you start to really rapidly realize this is so much bigger than that yeah it it has to do with your children and your grandchildren and do you want your [ __ ] grandchildren the banks own everything they [ __ ] own everything

in 40 [ __ ] years they own everything and there and then and then now we're starting to get into you know you want to get into conspiracy theories now we're starting to get into talking about digital currencies and everything else if they own everything and all the [ __ ] currencies are going into something digital you really think in another 50 years that your kids are going to wake up in a [ __ ] wonderful place we got goddamn cyborgs for [ __ ] sake Elon Musk is you can buy a goddamn

cyborg for $30,000 now they got flying cars in China they got they got these drone things all these drones and exploding drones and we we have to learn about all this stuff and learn about the structure the entire basis of America is personal property yeah the entire basis go all the way back to the late 1700s and start reading about court cases from that time period they're talking about personal property and how the state's entire [ __ ] purpose is to protect people and to have the right for

personal property everything I have taught you on this show is a complete satanic reversal of every America has ever stood for yeah if you love this country you know we we don't live in the same country anymore the country has been completely subverted and and if it's not for you and you're well Todo it it it's it it becomes it it's about other people it's about the future it's about the children and the grandchildren not who was it Thomas Jefferson or whoever that said that you know if the

bankers get into control everything we've worked for you know they're wake up homeless on the streets remember that quote or whatever I forget the exact quote you can look that up Ben Franklin or somebody said that something close to that that's what's going to [ __ ] happen was there homelessness 50 or 60 years ago homelessness almost didn't even exist 50 or 6 years ago and now I'm in California you can't walk down the [ __ ] road without seeing a homeless person we got homeless

encampments that is going to get worse and it's going to get worse because the banks own everything they inflate the monetary Supply whenever they want that if if the banks wanted to collapse almost every country in this entire world they could flick one switch and it'd be done in 24 hours yeah and that's unacceptable totally well it's all about education like I always say Financial education education about you know what we think is financial education that really isn't and what we can do about it

and uh you know thank you for your time wisdom uh I will link all your websites in our show notes your main one is uh is one that we love it's on stupid fuck.com you also have a a law firm that you run which is a attorney in fact Law Firm if I'm saying that right it's Williams and williams.com and he's got all kinds of resources on there including his litigation um you know Brandon is all over the the internet lots of other great podcasts that essentially talk about the things that we talk about here
