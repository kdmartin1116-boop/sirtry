since 2007, McGraw hill Construction 

has been closely tracking the business 
impacts of these technology advances 
through its smartMarket report 
series, with a particular focus on how 
Building information Modeling (BiM) is 
transforming the design and construction 
process in asia, north america and 
Western europe. During that period, 
construction companies have emerged  
as the leading drivers of BiM innovation 
and value.

This report analyzes new survey data 
collected exclusively from construction 
companies that use BiM in nine of the 
world’s top construction markets to 
improve productivity, efficiency, quality, 
safety and their own competitiveness. 
among the key findings:
■■ Three quarters of the construction 

companies report a positive Return on 
Investment (ROI) on their BIM program 
investment and have clear ideas about 
how to further improve ROI.

■■ Fewer errors and omissions, less  
rework and lower construction  
costs are among the top five BIM  
benefits cited by contractors.

■■ Over the next two years, contractors 
expect the percentage of their work  
that involves BIM will increase by  
50% on average.

■■ BIM ROI increases directly with a 

contractor’s level of BIM engagement, 
represented by its BIM experience, skill 
level and commitment to doing a high 
percentage of its work in BIM.

■■ Contractors in all markets are planning 

significant investments to expand  
their BIM programs over the next two 
years, including an increasing focus 
on internal and external collaborative 
procedures as well as mobile hardware 
and BIM software.

although BiM implementation has been 
underway for many years in Canada, 
france, Germany, uk and the us, the 
markets that have begun adopting 
more recently, such as australia, Brazil, 
japan, korea and new Zealand, are 
showing tremendous momentum and 
are outperforming the more established 
regions in several key categories of the 
research, such as roi, commitment to 
investment, offering innovative new 
services and expanding the use of  
BiM to non-building projects like mining 
and manufacturing.

This is an exciting time in the global 

construction industry, and BiM is 
accelerating the pace of positive change for 
contractors of all types, sizes and locations. 
We would like to thank our partners for their 
support that allows us to continue to bring 
this exciting information to the industry.

s While Building Information Modeling (BIM) is rapidly expanding around the 
globe, there are significant differences between construction companies’ 
experience with and business benefits from BIM in various regions. This 
study builds upon McGraw hill Construction’s investigation of BiM in individual markets, including north 
america, europe and south korea, to demonstrate larger trends globally through data from contractors in 
10 countries: australia, Brazil, Canada, france, Germany, japan, new Zealand, south korea, uk and us.

BIM Across the Globe

BiM usage is accelerating powerfully, driven by 
major private and government owners who want 
to institutionalize its benefits of faster, more certain 
project delivery, and more reliable quality and cost. 
BiM mandates by us, uk and other government 
entities demonstrate how enlightened owners can set 
specific targets and empower design and construction 
companies to leverage BiM technologies to meet and 
exceed those goals, also driving BiM into the broader 
project ecosystem in the process. resulting BiM 
adoption in north america skyrocketed from 28% to 71% 
between 2007 and 2012, and the uk and other regions 
are poised for similar dramatic expansions. adoption by 
contractors (74%) recently exceeded architects (70%) in 
north america, and this group is increasingly showing 
leadership in driving BiM innovation, metrics and value.

Return on Investment (ROI) for BIM
Three quarters of all contractors surveyed report a 
positive ROI on their investment in BIM. While there is 
no standard metric for measuring roi on BiM (unlike 
more standard measurements on project roi), the 
largest percentage of firms estimate the roi on their BiM 
investments to be between 10% and 25%. The findings 
demonstrate that each region has a unique set of metrics 
that are considered important and different drivers that 
construction companies believe will improve their return.
■■ Japanese, German and French contractors report the 

top ROI on BIM investments, with South Korea, the UK 
and the US trailing all regions.

■■ Financial metrics, such as reduced cost, higher 

profitability and higher productivity, are generally 
considered the most important category for measuring 
ROI on BIM investments, followed by metrics related to 
the project delivery process, such as fewer RFI’s, fewer 
unplanned changes, higher customer satisfaction and 
less disruption in project process.

■■ Embracing the collaborative nature of BIM projects, 
60% of contractors in all regions expressed the belief 
that further enhancements of visualization with BIM 
would probably have the most positive impact on their 
BIM ROI.

looking forward, creating and managing facilities 
management-enabling models for owners after 
construction may prove to be one of the most important 
new service revenue streams and contributors to roi  
for contractors.

s Contractors Are Enjoying a Wide 
Variety of Important BIM Benefits
The top project-related benefits that contractors are 
receiving from BIM are reduced errors and omissions 
and reduced rework, both of which have immediate 
positive impact and contribute to strong roi. reduced 
construction cost, reduced project duration and improved 
safety round out the top five project benefits of BiM.

Contractors cite BIM’s ability to enhance 

collaboration among key team members as its most 
important contribution to improving the project 
delivery process. Better cost control/predictability, and 
reduced cycle time for workflows and approvals are also 
acknowledged as important process benefits of BiM.

BIM Engagement Is Key Driver of 
Greater BIM Benefits
The more deeply that construction companies become 
engaged with BIM, the greater their ability to receive its 
benefits and to realize very strong return on their invest-
ments in BIM. McGraw hill Construction developed a BiM 
engagement index to measure the level of engagement 
for every contractor that participated in this research, 
based on their experience, skill and the percentage of BiM 
projects they work on. analyzing the research findings 
by respondents’ BiM engagement level demonstrates a 
clear business benefit to higher levels of engagement:
■■ Half of the contractors at the highest level of BIM 

engagement are reporting very positive ROI—in excess 
of 25% on their investment in BIM—compared with 11% 
of the firms at the lowest level, over a third of whom are 
still at negative or break-even ROI. 

■■ BIM is significantly reducing costly rework on projects 
for 40% of the highest BIM engagement contractors, 
versus only 28% of those at a low engagement level. 

Contractors Plan Aggressive 
Investments in BIM Programs
Contractors around the world are focusing most highly 
on investing in their internal collaborative processes, 
BIM training and BIM software in the next two years. 
almost two thirds (61%) of contractors at the highest 
level of BiM engagement are focusing on new/upgraded 
tablets/mobile devices, which will allow them to bring 
the value of BiM to the staff in the field. only about half as 
many (38%) of the other contractors surveyed are placing 
a high priority on that category of investment.

Observations and Recommendations

Observations and Recommendations

Model-based technologies and processes will continue to power 
the industry’s evolution. Contractors need to stay abreast of the 
key trends that will give shape to the future of the industry. 

logistical planning and 
decision-making 

robotics enhancing 
consistency and safety.   

Performance 
Metrics
Early-stage BIM users 
need to compare 
performance metrics 
from pre-BIM projects 
to establish the value of 
basic BIM benefits such as 
virtual coordination and 
to justify their continued 
BIM investments. More 
experienced BiM firms 
should analyze their 
completed BiM projects 
to refine the approach to 
more complex BiM uses 
on their new projects, such 
as determining in advance 
the best ratio of model-
driven prefabrication to 
site-built construction to 
optimize cost, schedule 
and site logistics. 

Emerging Uses of 
Modeled Data 
Basic modeling and 
virtual coordination are 
quickly becoming routine. 
To remain competitive 
contractors need to 
embrace emerging uses 
for leveraging model data. 
■■ Laser scanning to 
capture existing 
conditions and integrate 
with models

■■ Hyper-realistic 

immersive visualization 
to communicate 
complex information 
among multiple parties 
extremely efficiently, and 
more effectively engage 
clients and prospects for 
a competitive edge 

Industrialization 
of Construction
Model-driven prefabrica-
tion and the accelerating 
use of modular building 
elements are the leading 
edge of a tectonic shift in 
how construction projects 
will be designed, assem-
bled and maintained. 
■■ Major pre-engineered 
multi-system assem-
blies will be available 
from manufacturers’ 
catalogs, and produced 
on-demand from highly 
automated factories 
designed for mass-
customization rather 
than mass-production, 
keeping costs low, allow-
ing a variety of aesthetic 
options, optimizing 
material usage and 
reducing waste. 

■■ Augmented reality to 

■■ Work at project sites 

blend models with live 
camera views of reality 

■■ Simulation and anal-

ysis to optimize 

will focus primarily on 
assembly of these manu-
factured elements, with 
extensive GIS-controlled 

Many new businesses will 
form to serve this market, 
and existing companies 
will need to embrace the 
change, determine where 
they provide value and 
stake out their role, or else 
risk becoming irrelevant. 

Redefining the 
Construction 
Company
Traditionally, contrac-
tors simply built what 
design professionals 
drew. as project complex-
ity increased and fluctu-
ating market conditions 
created more uncertainty, 
contractors began provid-
ing expertise as advisors 
to the design process for 
cost, schedule and con-
structability issues. 

now that contractors’ 

adoption of BiM is 
surpassing design 
professionals in major 
markets such as north 
america, and formerly 
separate discipline-specific 
workflows are integrating 
into a more holistic 
and efficient approach 
to project delivery, 
construction companies 
have the opportunity 
to leverage technology 
innovations and redefine 

their role in the industry, 
deepening their long-term 
relationships with owners.  
■■ Project planning: 

Contractors can be 
valued advisors to 
owners’ capital planning 
processes, not just 
implementers. 
■■ Productization: 

Contractors, particularly 
the trades, have 
the opportunity to 
manufacture and service 
complex assemblies as 
standardized products, 
rather than custom-
building for each 
project with no ongoing 
economy of scale or post-
project revenue stream.
■■ Model management for 
owners: as the entity 
managing all the digital 
project information into 
its final physical form, 
contractors are ideally 
situated to organize and 
manage the information 
over the long term  
for owners, creating 
lifecycle engagement  
and an entirely new 
revenue source.  

a firm’s ability to  
succeed will depend  
on its willingness to 
innovate and embrace  
the business opportunities 
that these advancing 
technologies provide. n

In addition to this 

quantitative study, 
qualitative research

Number of Years Contractors Have Been Using BIM 

BiM has established traction among contractors in all the 
major construction markets surveyed for this research, 
with some markets showing greater maturity than others.

Length of Time Contractors Have 
Been Using BIM
(By region/Country)

BIM is Reaching Maturity  
Among Contractors in Europe  
and North America
The technology for modeling buildings, which is now 
generally termed BiM, was initially developed in europe, 
so it is no wonder that 12% of the contractors using BIM 
in France, Germany and the UK report that they have 
been doing so for six or more years. This is particularly 
true for the uk, where 19% of BiM general contractors 
claim more than 10 years’ experience. This shows strong 
growth from McGraw hill Construction’s 2010 research in 
these three countries1 where less than a quarter (24%) of 
contractors were using BiM at all. 

Meanwhile BIM adoption among contractors in North 

america has grown dramatically in recent years, now 
topping 70%, according to McGraw Hill Construction’s 
research in 2012.2 This is demonstrated by the finding 
that more than a third (36%) of the BiM-using contractors 
in the us and Canada have six or more years of 
experience, greater than twice the number that were at 
that level in 2009. 

BIM is Becoming Established With 
Contractors in Other Regions
Japan, South Korea and australia/New Zealand 
represent the next tier of maturity, with the majority 
of their contractor BIM users falling in the three to five 
years experience tier. This finding reflects the more 
recent adoption in these regions, but it also shows how 
rapidly BiM is advancing. for example, south korean 
contractors show a 65% BiM adoption rate in McGraw 
hill Construction’s 2012 research of that region.3 Thus, 
although this country is relatively new to BiM, there are 
many contractors participating.

BIM Implementation

The level of BiM implementation refers to the percentage 
of a contractor’s projects that involve BiM. McGraw hill 
Construction has been using a consistent scale for BiM 
implementation in research studies since 2009.
■■ Light Implementation Level: Less than 15% of  

projects using BIM
■■ Medium: 15% to 29%
■■ Heavy: 30% to 59%
■■ Very Heavy: 60% or more

Relationship Between BIM 
Implementation Level and Years of 
BIM Experience
McGraw hill Construction research consistently shows 
that as experience advances, users typically deepen their 
level of BiM implementation. This trend is demonstrated 
among contractors in this research as well.
■■ across all regions surveyed, the majority (60%) of 

contractors currently operate at light or medium BIM 
implementation (i.e., 30% or fewer of their projects). 
This is expected to shift dramatically in the next two 
years, by which time more than two thirds expect to be 
heavy or very heavy BiM implementers (i.e., more than 
30% of their projects).

■■ While only a fraction (10%) of the contractors with one 

to two years of experience are operating at high or 
very high BIM implementation levels, this percentage 
skyrockets to almost two thirds (64%) by the time they 
reach five or more years of experience.

There are interesting differences among the results 
related to this forecasted increase in BiM implementation.
■■ at 55%, US contractors already lead the rest 

of the regions surveyed for high and very high 
implementation, so their increase to 79% is relatively 
modest as a percentage, compared with Brazilian 
contractors who will reach almost the same level (73%), 
but from starting points of just 24%, representing more 
than a threefold increase. 

■■ although general contractors and trades are roughly 

equal in their current percentages of high and very high 
level BIM implementers (39% and 38% respectively), 
the general contractors are predicting reaching 70% in 
two years, while trades are more modest at 64%.

BIM Expertise  

although there is no globally accepted standard by which 
to rate BiM expertise, in each of its BiM surveys since 
2009, McGraw hill Construction has asked respondents 
to classify themselves by one of four levels: beginner, 
moderate, advanced or expert. although subjective, this 
self-assessment of skill level into a few broad categories 
provides a useful way to filter results and understand 
variances in user perceptions and experiences.

as would be expected, there is a broad variety in  
the findings about relative levels of BiM expertise in  
this research.
■■ While contractors in North america lead for the 

combined percentage of advanced and expert BIM 
users (53% in the US and 44% in Canada), Japan shows 
a similarly high percentage of experts (17%), as does 
France with advanced users (35%). 

■■ the highest percentage of beginners is in the UK 

(37%), likely reflecting the recent surge of BIM users 
in response to the recently announced government 
mandate for BIM. 

■■ almost half of contractors from medium and large 

companies (47% and 49%, respectively) claim advanced 
or expert BIM skills, compared with just over a quarter 
of contractors from small companies (29%). 

one area of continuity among the findings on  
BiM expertise is between general and trade  
contractors, where each has about the same combined 
percentage of advanced and expert BiM users (42% and 
44%, respectively).

BIM Expertise Correlates Directly With 
Experience and BIM Implementation
skill grows directly with experience, demonstrated  
by the finding that while only 10% of contractors with one 
to two years of experience are advanced or expert BiM 
users, the percentage grows to over a third (37%) among 
three- to four-year users and to almost three quarters 
(71%) by the time a contractor has five or more years of 
BiM experience.

BiM expertise also correlates directly with level of 
BiM implementation. only 10% of contractors at a low 
implementation level (less than 15% of projects involve 
BiM) report having advanced or expert BiM skill, versus 
those with high and very high BiM implementation  
(71% and 84%, respectively).

Contractors’ Perception of BIM Proficiency 
among trades

The success of a BiM project for a general contractor 
often relies heavily on the BiM proficiency of the trade 
contractors that are part of the project team.

Steel and Mechanical Contractors 
Lead the Industry Globally
the steel fabricators/erectors stand out as the leaders 
for BIM proficiency, with 56% of all general contractors 
surveyed rating their proficiency as high or very high. 
The perception by general contractors of the level of BiM 
skills among steel contractors increases directly with the 
general contractors’ size, years of BiM experience, level of 
BiM implementation and their own BiM skill level, as the 
following percentages of firms perceiving steel contractors 
to have a high/very high proficiency on BiM reveals:
• 65% of large general contractors versus 44% of  

small companies

• 68% of contractors with five or more years’ experience 

versus only 40% of those with 1–2 years 

• 71% that are operating at a very high level of BiM 

implementation (over 60% of projects involve BiM), 
compared with 45% of general contractors at low 
implementation (under 15% of projects involve BiM) 
• 71% of general contractors with expert levels of BiM 
skill as opposed to just 41% of beginner level users

 following in close second (52%) to the steel contractors 
in terms of recognition of their BiM proficiency are the 
mechanical/sheet metal/plumbing contractors. again, 
recognition of their BiM skills also increases directly based 
on general contractors’ size and BiM maturity. it stands to 
reason that as more general contractors expand their BiM 
programs, these two categories of specialty contractor will 
rise in esteem and value for their BiM capabilities.

Regional BIM Proficiency Ratings for 
Categories of Trade Contractors
The matrix shows the full range of responses for the 
percentage of general contractors by country that 
included each type of trade contractor among its top 
three most proficient with BiM. 

among all regions, French and German general 

contractors have the highest opinion of the BIM skills of 
the trade contractors they work with. The fact that BiM 
began in Western europe is probably an important factor 
influencing this finding because the companies have had 
a longer time to work together to cultivate their BiM skills 
and processes.
■■ Electrical contractors rate more highly in France (77%) 

and Germany (68%) than any of the other regions, 
where the average is just 30%, and they earn an 
even higher rating in France and Germany than the 
universally popular steel and mechanical trades. 
■■ Each category of trade contractor earns at least  
a 50% top designation from French and German 
general contractors, which compares very  
favorably to the average of 32% for all trades in  
all other regions combined. 

Brazil, South Korea and UK show the lowest levels of 
overall satisfaction with the BIM proficiency of trade 
contractors. This probably directly relates to the fact that 
these three regions have the most BiM users with low 
experience, skills and implementation.
■■ UK (24%), South Korea (19%) and Brazil (18%) have the 
highest percentages of contractors with just one year 
of experience, as opposed to an average of 9% for the 
other regions combined. 

■■ UK (37%) and South Korea (34%) have the highest 

percentages of contractors at the beginner level of 
BIM expertise, versus an average of 20% for the other 
regions combined.

■■ South Korea (56%), UK (44%) and Brazil (35%) have the 
highest numbers of contractors that are at a low level 
of BIM implementation (doing less than 15% of their 
projects in BIM), as compared with the average for all 
other regions of 21%.

BIM Engagement Index 

each contractor is engaged with BiM in a unique 
way. McGraw hill Construction has developed a BiM 
engagement index to quantify engagement with a 
numerical score for each respondent that participated in 
this research. The score is derived from the following data:
• experience: the number of years the contractor has

been using BiM

36% 36%

• expertise: the level each contractor selected as best 

representing their skill with BiM

• implementation: the percentage of the contractor’s 

current projects that involve BiM

These responses are weighted to reflect the increasing 
level of engagement that is represented by more 
experience, skill and/or implementation. and each of 
the three criteria is weighted against the others to reflect 
its relative degree of importance for BiM engagement, 
with expertise being the most valuable, followed by 
experience, then implementation level.

• the lowest possible score for each of the three criteria 

is one point. 

• Very heavy implementation (more than 60% of projects 

involve BiM) earns eight points.

• More than five years’ BiM experience earns nine points. 
• expert BiM skill level earns 10 points. 

using this scoring system, each contractor’s BiM 
engagement index falls somewhere in a range from three 
points to 27 points. 

To provide a way to analyze a large group of 

contractors in a region and be able to compare regions, 
McGraw hill Construction divided the overall range into 
four standard levels, from light BiM engagement (firms 
with generally low experience and skill, who are not 
doing very many BiM projects), through medium and 
high levels, to very high BiM engagement (companies 
with a great deal of experience and expertise who are 
executing more than 60% of their projects with BiM). each 
contractor’s BiM engagement index score falls into one of 
these four standard levels.

McGraw hill Construction intends to track the progress 
of users and regions through its continuing research over 
the years as BiM expands and users become more deeply 
engaged. This benchmarking system for evaluating BiM 
engagement provides useful targets, expectations and 
goals for users and entire regions as they advance.

BIM Engagement Level for  
All Contractors in All Regions
Combining results from all regions that participated 
in this research, over one third (36%) of the BIM-using 
contractors are currently in the low BIM engagement 
group, while a small number (11%) are at a very high BIM 
engagement level. This distribution is appropriate for this 
point in time of the advancing maturity of BiM across the 
world, and provides a reasonable framework for tracking 
future expansion and growth.

Comparing BIM Engagement  
by Region
The percentage of users in a given region that  
populate each of the various levels is a useful  
way to compare regions in terms of their overall  
degree of BiM engagement.
■■ the UK shows a very large percentage of low 
engagement users (54%) due to the recently 
announced government BIM mandates, but also has a 
relatively large population (28%) at high and very high 
engagement levels. 

■■ due to both the length of time that BIM has been 
actively deployed there and the rapid pace of its 
growth , the US has both the fewest low-level users 
(21%) and the largest numbers at high and very high 
levels (22% each). 

Impact of Contractor Size on  
BIM Engagement
Consistent with other findings that larger contractors 
have more BiM experience, more advanced skills and 
deeper levels of implementation, there is a direct relation 
between size and overall BiM engagement.

Impact of BIM Expertise on Team Formation

as more companies engage with BiM, the value of having 
other team members with BiM experience becomes 
increasingly important. however, companies currently 
are taking different approaches to using BiM expertise as 
a selection factor in the team formation process.

about a third (30%) of the contractors surveyed make a 

practice of requiring BiM on their projects.
■■ this is more common among medium (37%) and large 
(33%) contractors, compared with only 16% of small 
companies that may not feel they have the influence to 
demand BIM.

■■ BIM is also much more frequently mandated 
by contractors with high and very high BIM 
implementation levels (48% and 51%, respectively), and 
expert (59%) and advanced (43%) BIM skills. 

over half (53%) report that they encourage BiM expertise 
but do not yet require it. in addition, only 17% say that 
BiM expertise does not affect their decisions, a group 
which includes:

• 25% of small companies 
• 27% of contractors with just one to two years  

of experience

• 34% of beginner skill level contractors
• over a third (37%) of all contractors that are at a light 

BiM implementation level (doing less than 15% of their 
work with BiM)

These findings suggest that as BiM becomes more 
established in many regions, all contractors will increase 
the degree to which they require BiM capability on their 
project teams. 

Variation by Country/Region
japanese (7%) and south korean (11%) contractors 
lead in reporting the smallest percentage of BiM-using 
contractors that do not consider BiM expertise in their 
team-formation process. With over a third of contractors 
requiring it, Germany (39%), France (37%) and Brazil 
(37%) show the greatest commitment to BIM as a vital 
factor in team formation.

BIM Influence Grows Via Government Mandates

As BIM adoption continues to grow around the world, governments 
are promoting its ability to eliminate waste on public projects and 
even mandating its use as a part of construction sector reform, cost-
saving efforts and climate-change mitigation strategies.

United Kingdom (UK)
under francis Maude, Minister for 
the Cabinet office, the uk govern-
ment is implementing a construc-
tion strategy that states BiM will be 
a key part of the government’s pro-
curement of public buildings and, by 
2016, model-based BiM will be man-
datory on all public sector projects, 
including delivery of all project and 
asset information, documentation 
and data. The uk government has 
also developed a BiM Task Group to 
support and assist both government 
clients and supply-chain contractors 
in transitioning their work practices 
to BiM and electronic delivery. 

The overarching goal of this strat-

egy is to reduce capital costs and 
carbon dioxide creation from the con-
struction and operation of the built 
environment by 20%. The idea is that 
using BiM will unlock project efficien-
cies through enabled processes such 
as early clash detection and building 
component prefabrication and allow 
for better sustainable building design 
and operation.

“We have a managed program 

that helps the government 
departments be consistent about 
how they ask for information from 
BiM processes. We also have a 
set of activities to help the supply 
chain meet demands from the 
client side,” says adam Matthews, 
head of european development for 
the uk BiM Task Group. “We work 
both sides of the equation. it’s very 
much a support role we provide to 
government departments, then on 

the supply side we help with the 
foundation activities, we put in  
place standards, training support  
and guidance.”

The BiM Task Group is halfway 
through a five-year rollout to bring all 
publicly funded projects up to what 
the Task Group defines as level 2 
BiM. in the uk maturity ramp, level 
2 is defined as “file-based collabora-
tion and library management.” This 
includes a series of domain-specific 
models—such as architectural, 
structural, and mechanical, electri-
cal and plumbing [MeP] services 3D 
models—all within a single environ-
ment where structured data can be 
shared. The information sharing envi-
ronment being used by the BiM Task 
Group is a version of the Construc-
tion operations Building exchange 
(CoBie) called CoBie uk 2012. CoBie 
is a data-exchange format created 
by Bill east of the us army Corps of 
engineers. CoBie helps capture and 
record important project data at the 
point of origin, including equipment 
lists, product data sheets, warranties, 
spare parts lists and preventive main-
tenance schedules.

The Bsi (British standards 

institute) has created an information 
sharing standard called Pas 1192:2. 
it’s a publicly available specification 
created in consultation with industry 
and government institutions that 
delineates a workable definition of 
level 2 technology compliance in 
terms of building project information 
sharing. Pas 1192:2 is not a standard 
that mandates hardware or software. 

it, rather, defines key exchange 
points between client and supply 
chain at different stages of a building 
project and how to exchange 
information when those points are 
reached. it sets a clear framework 
for information management 
by identifying deliverables to be 
produced (such as a BiM execution 
Plan, a 3D building information 
model and others), when they are 
to be produced, what information 
sources they draw from and what 
they can be used for. Pas 1192:2 
also defines best practices for 
these project deliverables. it lists 
more than 20 items that should 
form its employers information 
requirement at a minimum. Design 
software, other tools and work-
process decisions are left up to the 
individual project teams but are 
required to be defined at a project’s 
outset in documents such as the BiM 
execution Plan.

 The Task Group is currently 
working on developing Pas 1192:3, 
a standard for ongoing operational 
use of model information for facil-
ities and asset management. The 
BiM Task Group, now three years 
into its five-year program, is start-
ing to see adoption of BiM practices 
by government clients. a number of 
departments in the uk government, 
including the Ministry of justice and 
the highways agency, are engaged 
and starting early adopter projects. 
Many of the uk’s professional insti-
tutions and federations are playing 
a role in level 2 uptake. The royal

institute of Chartered surveyors 
(riCs) has released a series of BiM 
manager’s training courses that align 
closely to the BiM Task Group’s 2012 
learning outcomes document. The 
royal institute of British architects 
(riBa) is also playing a role in level 
2 adoption. riBa’s 2013 Plan of Work 
document aligns eight stages of work 
in a building project to data exchange 
points outlined in Pas 1192:2.

Singapore
singapore has implemented the 
world’s first BiM-based rapid 
building permitting system. 
The Building and Construction 
authority (BCa) led a multi-agency 
effort in 2008 that implemented 
”e-submission,” the world’s first 
model-based submission system. 
e-submission streamlines the 
process for regulatory submission. 
Project teams only need to submit 
one building information model, 
which contains all of the information 
needed to meet the requirements 
of singapore’s regulatory agencies. 
in 2010, nine regulatory agencies 
accepted architectural 3D models for 
approval through e-submission. in 
2011, MeP and structural BiM models 
were accepted via e-submission. 
More than 200 projects have been 
approved via e-submission to date.

Scandinavia
in norway, the civil state client 
statsbygg mandated BiM use for 
the lifecycle of their buildings. By 
2010, all of statsbygg projects were 
using the industry foundation class 
file format (ifC/ifD-based BiM). ifC 
is a platform neutral, open, object-
based file format developed by the 
BuildingsMarT alliance to facilitate 
interoperability in the aeC industries. 

BuildingsMarT is an international 
non-profit organization that aims to 
improve the exchange of information 
between software applications.
in finland, the state property 

services agency, senate Properties, 
has required the use of BiM for its 
projects since 2007. Many public 
property and government clients 
also require BiM for their projects in 
Denmark and sweden. The high rate 
of adoption of archiCaD as a BiM 
design tool and the high use of ifC 
for file and information sharing has 
led to rapid adoption of BiM practices 
in the scandinavian design and 
construction industries.

norway, along with the uk, 

recently hosted a meeting of public 
owners from 13 european nations 
in Brussels last october to explore 
ways of working together in support 
of public estate policy goals and 
improving the competitiveness of  
the eu construction sector.

US BIM Initiatives
in the us, the General services 
administration, the agency that man-
ages all federal buildings, has been 
requiring BiM through its national 
3D-4D-BiM program through the 
office of the Chief architect of 
its Public Buildings service. The 
national BiM standard (nBiMs 2.0) 
from the BuildingsMarT alliance is 
continuing to evolve with version 3.0 
expected to be released in early 2014. 
While nBiMs is not a mandate or 
required standard, it does enjoy the 
backing of many major software ven-
dors and several of the bigger design 
firms and construction companies.
“There are more best practices 
out there than standard practices,” 
says Deke smith, faia, program 
director at the Washington, 

DC-based national institute of 
Building sciences, a non-profit, non-
governmental organization that 
includes BuildingsMarT as one 
of its member councils. “it doesn’t 
make any sense to have all the firms 
developing their own best practices.”
nBiMs 2.0 is based on sharing 

information via ifC, an open-
file format. smith says that 
improvements made to the file 
format, itself, by BuildingsMarT will 
allow ifC to be used for information 
sharing on any BiM project. 

“ifC always worked,” smith says. 
“it was the software implementation 
of it that did not work too well. now 
we have validated that it does, 
indeed, work… there is an ifC 
certification 2.0 administered by 
BuildingsMarT that confirms that  
it can work for this level of 
information exchange.”

as with the uk BiM mandate, 
nBiMs also allows information 
sharing via CoBie. The version of 
CoBie that will be in version 3 of 
nBiMs is the same version being 
used by the uk BiM Task Group. it 
was actually added in nBiMs 2.26. 
smith says that once the uk BiM 
Task Group started using it, more 
software vendors came around and 
said “okay, it’s worth it to us to invest 
in writing the software for this.”

“We want all vendors to be able 

to write software to support the 
nBiMs,” smith explains. “The suc-
cess we have had so far with CoBie 
is going to help us. it’s a very good 
example of how information can 
flow from design through construc-
tion with the intent of delivering that 
to the facility manager. as that grows 
and people become more comfort-
able with sharing information, we 
believe adoption will grow.” n

Top BIM Benefits
ThebusinessbenefitsofBIMwilldriveitscontinued
globalexpansionandtheincreasingdepthofBIM

ConstructionhasbeentrackingthedegreetowhichBIM
usersarereceivingspecificbenefitsasawaytopredict
theresultingincreaseinimplementationandprovide
reasonableexpectationsforusersintheearlystagesof
theirengagement.

ContraCtors’ top three BIM BenefIts
Forpurposesofthisresearch,contractorswereaskedto
selectthreebenefitsfromalistof15thattheywouldrate
asatopbenefit.

Across all regions that participated in this research, 
BIM’s impact on reducing errors and omissions ranked 
as the top benefit. Eliminatingerrorsandomissionsalso
enhancesotherhigh-scoringdownstreambenefitssuch
asreducingrework,constructioncostandoverallproject
duration.SoasBIMengagementincreases,theentire
projectdeliverycycleisimproved.

Leveraging BIM to improve collaboration with owners 

and design firms also scored very highly with over a 
third (35%) of contractors. Thisfindinghighlightsthe
increasingtrendtowardgreaterintegrationamongall
teammembers,oneofthemostimportanttrendsfrom
model-orientedprojects.

andregulatoryapprovals.
TherearethreetypesofBIMbenefitsexaminedin
thisresearch:

• Internal Benefits: Business benefits that accrue 

primarily to the contractor that is using BIM 

• Project Benefits: Benefits that primarily improve the 

project on which BIM is being deployed

• Process Benefits: Benefits that enhance project 

workflows and processes between the parties on a 
BIM project

■■ French contractors tend to be at the extremes, ranking 

first for increased profits and maintaining repeat 
business, but second to last in believing that BIM is 
enhancing their overall image and last in leveraging 
BIM to market new business.

■■ the South Koreans and Japanese, on the other hand, 

are the leaders in marketing new business and offering 
new services, perhaps because BIM is more of a novelty 
in their regions.

stronglywithtradecontractors,where43%placeit
amongtheirtopthreeBIMbenefitsversusonly31%
ofgeneralcontractors.Thismayrelatetothegrowing
awarenessoftheimportanceofhavingallthebuildteam
membersskilledwithBIM;therefore,tradecontractors
withBIMskillarerecognizedandacknowledged.

■■ Increased Profitability: Inthemiddleoftherankingfor
internalbenefitswith14%ofallcontractorsratingitas
oneoftheirtopthreebenefits,improvedprofitability
earnsatopratingfromalmosttwiceasmanytrade
contractors(22%)thangeneralcontractors(12%).
■■ Maintaining Repeat Business: owingtothenature

ofrepeatbusinessfortradecontractorswithgeneral
contractorsthataresuccessfulworkingwiththem,
16%oftradecontractorsratethisbenefitamong

contractors.ThisreflectshowBIMcanconsistently
makeatradecontractormoreattractivetogeneral
contractorsasarepeatprojectteammember.

Top Project Benefits of BIM
Contractorsinallregionsreportthatprojectsare
benefitingdirectlyfromBIM.

Reduced errors and omissions earned the highest 

overall average among all BIM benefits (with 41% of 
contractors including it among their top three) and a top 
rating from almost two thirds of South Korean (63%) and 
over half of Canadian (51%) contractors.Therelatively
lowrankinggiventoitbyFrenchandGermancontractors
mayrelatetoerrorsandomissionsbeinglessofa
probleminthoseregions,thereforeotherBIMbenefits
earnedmorerecognitionfromthem,suchasprofitability
(39%inFrance)andreducedoverallprojectduration(38%
inGermany).

reducedreworkisanimportantbenefitbecauseit
canaffectprojectcostandduration,aswellaspositively
impactingproductivityandtheoverallefficiencyofthe
projectdeliveryprocess.Forty percent of contractors 
with a very high BIM Engagement Index say reduced 
rework is among their top three BIM benefits compared 
with just 28% of those with a low BIM Engagement 
Index,highlightingtheincreasingimpactofthisbenefit
onmoreBIM-intensiveprojects.

perhapsbecauseofthecomplexityofprojectsandthe

■■ Reduced errors and omissions earns a top three rating 
from half (50%) of large contractors as opposed to a 
third (34%) of small ones. 

■■ Reduced rework is also more widely appreciated 
among large contractors (40%) than small (23%).

Top Process Benefits of BIM
Contractors’useofBIMisimprovingprojectworkflows
andprocessesontheirprojects.

the ability for contractors to collaborate more 
effectively with owners/design firms is the leader 
among process-related BIM benefits.

■■ this benefit earns a top three rating from over twice as 
many contractors at a very high BIM engagement level 
(48%) than those at a low BIM engagement level (22%), 
highlighting the collaborative value of BIM. 

■■ More large contractors select this as a top benefit (41%) 
than small firms (25%), probably an indication of the 
greater complexity and larger teams their projects 
entail, where more collaboration yields greater benefit. 

Bettercostcontrolandpredictabilityisacritically
importantbenefitthatwillgreatlyimproveproject

BIM Benefits, ROI and Investments 

contInued

Contractors’ Current Perception of ROI  

Thereisnosinglewidelyacceptedmethodforcalculating
acompany’sreturnonitsinvestments(roI)inBIM,
butmostusershaveaperceptionofthevaluethey
arereceivingforthetime,moneyandefforttheyhave
expendedontheirBIMprogram.TheroIdiscussed
throughoutthisanalysisisnotprojectroI,butthe
estimatedroIoninvestmentinBIM.

Perceived ROI on BIM
Since2009McGrawHillConstructionhasaskedusersto
sharetheirperceptionofroIaspartofitsBIMresearchin
asia,Europeandnorthamerica.EachBIMuserisasked
toestimateiftheirroIontheirBIMinvestmentsfallsinto
oneofsevennumericalranges.Thesevenrangesare
dividedintothreebroadtiersfortrendanalysis.
■■ tier One: Negative/Break-Even ROI on BIM Investments

• negative
• Break-even

■■ tier two: Moderately Positive ROI on BIM Investments

• Less than 10%
• 10%–25% 

■■ tier three: Very Positive ROI on BIM Investments

• 26%–50%
• 51%–100%
• over 100% 

Typical Pattern of ROI on BIM
aconsistentpatternemergesacrossthosestudies.
■■ Companies in their early years of BIM adoption exhibit 

negative or break-even ROI on BIM investments, 
especiallysmallerorganizationsforwhichittakes
longertoabsorbtheinitialcostsofsoftware,hardware
traininganddevelopmentofcontentandbusiness
processestosupportBIM.

■■ Contractors generally reach positive ROI more quickly 

than design professionals becausetheygenerally
receiveagreatershareofthefinancialbenefitsofBIM
(e.g.,reducedrework,increasedprofits,etc.)than
designfirms.

■■ Users with the deepest BIM engagement, as 

represented by their skill, years of experience and level 
of BIM implementation, report the highest ROI on their 
BIM investments.

contInued

ROI Among Contractors in  
this Research
ThefirstchartshowstheperceivedroIonBIM
investmentsfromcontractorssurveyedinthisresearch.
■■ three quarters (75%) of contractors currently believe 

they have a positive ROI on BIM investments.

■■ More trade contractors (14%) are receiving greater 

than 50% ROI on their investments in BIM than general 
contractors (10%).

■■ At the same time however, almost a third (31%) of trade 
contractors are in the negative or break-even groups, 
comparedwithlessthanaquarter(23%)ofgeneral
contractors,probablyrepresentingmanyrecentadopt-
ersthatarestillabsorbingtheimpactofBIMinvestment.

Impact of BIM Engagement on ROI
asisconsistentwithallpreviousMcGrawHill
ConstructionBIMresearch,thecontractorsinthisstudy
withdeeperlevelsofBIMengagementarereporting
muchhigherroIontheirBIMinvestments.
■■ Most (90%) of the contractors at very high BIM 

engagement have a positive ROI on their investments 
versus only about two thirds (65%) of the low BIM 
engagement firms. 

Contractors’ Perceived ROI on BIM
(ByCountry)
Source: McGraw Hill Construction, 2013

Very Positive ROI (Over 25%)
Moderately Positive ROI (Up to 25%)

Negative or Break-Even ROI

■■ Half (50%) of the contractors that have very high BIM 

engagement are in the very positive ROI tier compared 
with only 11% of their low engagement counterparts. 

Variation by Country/Region
Therelativelylargepercentageofcontractorsreporting
negativeorbreak-evenroIonBIMinvestmentsinthe
uS(26%),uk(41%)andSouthkorea(52%)probably
reflectsarecentincreaseofadoptionbycontractorsin
thoseregions,versusthemorestablemarketsinFrance,
Germanyandjapan(3%each).

Evenwiththerelativelylargenumberofnegative
andbreak-evencontractorsintheuk(41%),theoverall
averageforpositiveBIMroIinWesternEurope(uk,
FranceandGermany)is84%.Thisisupsharplyfrom
2010,whenMcGrawHillConstructionresearchfound
only40%ofWesternEuropeancontractorsreporting
positiveroIontheirBIMinvestments.

Future Dynamics of BIM ROI for 
Contractors
Thenearfuturewillbeverydynamicasmorecontractors
adoptBIM,populatingthenegativeorbreak-evenroItier,
andexistingBIMusersmoveupintothepositivetiersby
gainingskillsandexperience,implementingmoredeeply
acrosstheirorganizationsandamortizingtheinitialstartup
costsoftheirBIMprograms.Itcanbeexpectedthatthis
currentsnapshotofregionalroIonBIMinvestmentswill
continuetochangedramaticallyuntilBIMreachesabroad
levelofimplementationacrossallregionsandthecost/
benefitratiostabilizesforallusers.

BIM Engagement and  
Measurement of ROI
Contractors’levelofBIMengagementcorrelates
stronglywiththeirapproachtomeasuringroIon
BIMinvestments.
■■ Over twice as many contractors at the medium (41%), 
high (41%) and very high (43%) BIM engagement levels 
are in the regular measurement group, versusonly17%
ofthelowengagementfirms.

■■ the largest portion of low BIM engagement 

contractors (45%) are in the occasional measurement 
group, with another 38% not measuring at all.

■■ 32% of the very high BIM engagement contractors and 
30% of the high BIM engagement ones do not measure, 
perhapsbecauseBIMhasalreadyestablisheditsvalue
attheirfirmsanditnolongerneedstobeformally
measuredinordertojustifycontinuedinvestment.

Measurement of BIM ROI by Region
Thefindingsappeartosupporttheoldadage,“Youget
whatyoumeasure.”
■■ the regions that most actively measure ROI on BIM 

investments (France, Japan and Germany) also report 
the highest ROI on BIM. 

■■ two of the three regions that measure least frequently 
(US and South Korea) are also among the three with 
the lowest ROI.

Importance of ROI Metrics  

ContractorsthatmeasureroIonBIMinvestmentsusea
varietyofmetricstodoso.Contractorswereaskedtorate
therelativeimportanceoffivebasiccategoriesofmetrics
totheircompany’sprocessofmeasuringroI. Financial 
metrics are the most popular among all contractors, 
with an average of 69% rating them with high or very 
high importance.
■■ Financial Metrics (suchasreducedcost,higher

profitability,higherproductivity)
• these metrics have the top single rating among all 

metrics in all regions (93% in Japan) and the highest 
low rating (61% in Australia/new Zealand).
• they are favored somewhat more by general 

contractors (69%) than trade contractors (62%).

• they are especially preferred by contractors at a very 

high BIM engagement level (81%).

■■ Schedule metrics (suchasfasterprojectdelivery):
these metrics are rated with high or very high 
importance by almost a third (63%) of all contractors 
surveyed. Theyaregivenaveryhighimportance
ratingby31%ofgeneralcontractors,comparedwith
only20%oftradecontractors,likelyduetothegeneral
contractor’sgreaterroleofresponsibilityforoverall
projectschedule.

■■ Safety metrics: Methodsformeasuringtheimpact
ofBIMonsafetyarestillanemergingmetricamong
contractorsglobally.
•Safety only scores as high or very high with 50% 

of all contractors, with small companies (56%) leading 
large (46%).

• Japanese firms (86%) stand out in giving it a top rating. 
the relatively low rating from South Korean (29%) and 
uS (35%) contractors should be interpreted as a lack of 
experience with measuring BIM impact on safety rather 
than a lack of interest in safety by those contractors.
■■ Project-related metrics other than financial, schedule 

or safety (suchasfewerrFI’s,fewerunplanned
changes,highercustomersatisfaction,lessdisruption
inprojectprocess)
• this broad category appeals to over two thirds (68%) of 
all contractors and almost three quarters (73%) of those 
at a very high BIM engagement level.

• Slightly more general contractors (69%) rate this 

category at high or very high importance than trade 
contractors (62%), probably because of their greater 
ability to experience positive impact over the scope of 
the full project.

trade firms (41%).

• twice as many of the contractors with very high BIM 
engagement rate this category of metric as top (very 
high) in importance versus just 10% of those with low 
BIM engagement, indicating that commitment to BIM 
directly impacts business performance.

Improvements to ROI 

Contractorswereaskedtodesignatethethreemost
importantBIMbenefitsintermsofhowmuchanincrease
ineachspecificbenefitwoulddirectlyimprovetheir
company’sroIonBIMinvestments.Thetopfiveare
showninthechart,bothbyregionandintotal,with
analysisbyengagementlevelandfirmtypelistedbelow.

Contractors’ BIM Engagement Level 
Influences Their Preferences
notsurprisingly,thecontractorswithdeeperBIM
engagementhavestrongopinionsaboutwhatbenefits,
ifincreased,wouldimprovetheroIontheirinvestment
inBIM.

Contractors with low BIM engagement gave more 

value to better communication and understanding 
from 3d visualization (57%) than those with very high 
BIM engagement (48%). Thisislikelyduetotherelative
noveltyoftheirlevelofexposuretothispotenttool
amongtheseearlyusers,whountilrecentlyhadtorelyon
2Ddrawingsandafewsketchestounderstandcomplex
designintent.MuchmoreexperiencedBIMuserscome
totakethiscapabilityforgrantedandhavelikelygotten
asmuchvalueaspossiblefromitand,therefore,are
focusedelsewhereforimprovement.

to that point, the contractors most highly engaged 
with BIM cited the improved process outcomes (77%) 
and improved productivity of personnel (43%) more 
frequently than those on the lowest engagement tier 
(47% and 34%, respectively).Thisisanaturaloutcome
oftheirextensionofBIMbenefitsbeyondimproved
visualizationintosubstantialbusinessbenefitsrelated
toworkflowefficiency,improvedutilizationofresources
andbetterprojectoutcomes.

Variation by Type of Firm
agreaterpercentageofgeneralcontractorsincluded
improvedprocessoutcomessuchasfewerrFI’s
(requestsforInformation)andfieldcoordination
problems(62%),reducedcycletimeforworkflowsand
projectdelivery(33%),andlowerprojectcost(29%)
amongtheirtopthreethantradecontractors(53%,26%
and21%,respectively).Thismayrelatetothemore
administrativenatureoftheirroleonprojects.

SeveralotherBIMbenefits,whichdidnotscore
amongthetopfiveshowninthechart,showeddistinct
preferencesbytradecontractors:

Thefinalthreeinvestmentprioritiesaremorespecialized,
addressinguniqueneedsofindividualcompanies.
■■ developing 3d custom libraries: Model-basedcontent

forBIMiscritical.althoughagrowingnumberof
manufacturersproduceBIMcontentfortheirproducts,
mostBIMusersneedadditionalcontentthatsupports
theirspecificactivities.Typicallyacombination
ofinternalskillsandthirdpartycontentcreation
consultantsarefillingthisneed.

■■ New/upgraded desktop machines: Dependingonthe
softwarethatisbeingusedandthefilesizesthatare
beingcreatedandmanaged,manycontractorsneedto
upgradetheirdesktophardware,andtheywilltypically
procurepowerfulcomputersforanynewBIMstaff.
■■ Software customization/interoperability solutions: 

oncecontractorsengagewithBIM,itbecomes
importanttotailorthefunctionalitytotheirspecific
needsandtointegratethedatawithotherapplications.
again,acombinationofinternalskillsandthird-partyIT
integrationspecialistsaremeetingcontractors’needs.

Investments Planned by Contractors 
at a Very High Engagement Level
keepinganeyeonthebehavioroftheindustry’sBIM
leadersisagoodwaytopredictwhateveryoneelseis
likelytobedoingshortlythereafter.Inthisinstancethe
veryhighBIMEngagementcontractorsplansignificantly
greater-than-averageinvestmentsinallcategories.

■■ the biggest difference is with new/upgraded tablets/

mobile devices, where 61% of the most engaged 
contractors are citing its top importance versus just 
38% of the total. Thisspeakstothegoalamongthe
moreadvanceduserstogetthevalueofBIMouttothe
staffinthefield.

■■ BIM software shows the second largest variance, likely
indicatingthatthemostengagedcontractorsplanto
addmoreBIMuserstotheirstaff.

Variation by Region
Combiningthepercentagesofcontractorsineveryregion
thatdesignatedeachBIMinvestmentasatop(highor
veryhigh)priorityoverthenexttwoyears,produces
anaverageforeachregionthatreflectstheintensityof
plannedBIMinvestmentbyitscontractors.
■■ Among the regions, South Korean contractors show 
the most enthusiasm for BIM investment, with an 
average of almost half (46%) designating top priority  
for all categories of BIM investment combined. 
TherapidrecentgrowthofBIMinSouthkorea—
demonstratedinthe2012Business Value of BIM in 
Korea SmartMarket Report—isalikelydriverforthis
commitmenttoexpansion.

■■ Most other regions fall in a tight range between 44% 

(Japan) and 38% (UK), establishing a reasonable 
baseline for the overall global industry.

Project Types Using BIM, According to Contractors  

BiM is being deployed on a growing variety of project 
types all over the world; not only in buildings but 
infrastructure, industrial and natural resources projects 
as well. Contractors in this research indicated all of 
the project types where they are currently using BiM. 
The charts show both the overall frequency of their 
responses by project type and the detail on percentages 
of contractors per project type in each region. 

BIM Project Types in All Regions

Building Project tyPes
Buildings are the dominant category for contractors 
using BiM, probably because its usage began mostly 
with architects for buildings projects, and that drew most 
contractors into engagement with BiM.
■■ BIM for commercial buildings is especially strong with 
85% of very high BIM engagement contractors using it 
versus the overall average of 63%. 

■■ Government buildings also attract an above-average 
number of very high BIM engagement contractors 
(79%), compared with the overall average of 49%, and 
only 29% of low BIM engagement firms. 

■■ BIM for institutional buildings, especially healthcare, 

is tremendously popular among very high BIM 
engagement contractors (85%), compared with the 
average of 54%, and is dominated by large firms  
(64%) as opposed to medium (40%) or small  
(38%) contractors. 

■■ Residential is still an emerging sector for BIM. Very 
high BIM engagement contractors (37%) are above 
the 23% average for multifamily, while low BIM 
engagement companies (8%) outpace the 6%  
average for single family projects, also the only  
project type dominated by small (10%) versus large 
(2%) contractors. 

non-Building Project tyPes
industrial/manufacturing is the most penetrated non-
building category for contractors to use BiM.
■■ Well over half (57%) of the very high BIM engagement 
firms are involved, versus 32% across all contractors. 
■■ Large contractors (35%) only show a slight edge over 
medium (31%) and small (29%) ones, indicating a well-
established distribution across the industry. 

■■ a higher percentage of trade contractors are using  

BIM (42%) than general contractors (30%), reflecting  
the importance of their role on industrial/
manufacturing projects.

medium (12%) and small (7%) ones, and contractors at the 
very high BiM engagement level are far above average 
(39%), reflecting the skill and sophistication required to 
apply BiM in this technically demanding market.

BIM Activities and Practices
Project types Using BIM, according to Contractors 

continued

BiM for infrastructure (e.g., highways/roads, bridges, 

tunnels, dams, water/wastewater) is a relatively small 
but growing activity globally. McGraw hill Construction’s 
2012 BIM for Infrastructure in North America SmartMarket 
Report showed that while only a quarter (27%) of 
infrastructure contractors were using BiM in 2009, almost 
half (46%) were doing so by 2011, and the percentage 
using it on over half of their infrastructure projects almost 
doubled from 16% to 29% over the same period.  
This research on BiM for infrastructure in nine global 
markets shows:
■■ a third (32%) of very high BIM engagement contractors 
use BIM for infrastructure, compared with only 8% of 
low BIM engagement firms. 

■■ Large firms (30%) show much higher than average 

(20%) participation in this activity.

at 5% overall, mining and natural resources is the least 
active sector for BiM. Very high BiM engagement firms 
(16%) handle most of the activity, and large companies 
(11%) outnumber medium (3%) and small (2%) ones. 

BIM Project Types by Region
The matrix shows the detail for contractors’ regional 
involvement with various BiM project types.
■■ Buildings projects are common across all regions, with 

Germany far greater than average in multifamily  
(44% versus 23%) and single family (22% versus 6%). 
■■ Infrastructure is also fairly consistent across all regions 
with UK (33%), Canada (31%) and Brazil (28%) showing 
the most activity.

■■ although all regions show strong industrial/manu-

facturing BIM activity, Japan (47%) stands out, which 
aligns well with its general commitment to state-of-
the-art manufacturing processes.

■■ Industrial/energy BIM activity is more localized, with 

Canada (28%), South Korea (21%) and UK (20%) all well 
above average (17%). 

■■ Mining and natural resources activity is concentrated 
in Canada (18%) and australia and New Zealand (11%), 
where these industries are most prevalent, and also 
somewhat popular in UK and Brazil (6% each).

Top Design/Pre-Construction BIM Activities 
for Contractors  

Contractors are finding numerous innovative ways to 
apply BiM to projects prior to the start of construction. in 
this study contractors were asked to select the three top 
ways that their organizations are leveraging BiM during 
design and pre-construction. 

Consistent with all of McGraw hill Construction’s 
previous research on BiM around the world, the top 
valued pre-construction activities relate to virtual 
coordination among trades, and the outstanding ability 
of BIM and related software tools to communicate the 
design intent. The following look at these top activities in 
terms of the overall averages and by how they compare 
by level of BiM engagement, firm type and firm size.
■■ Very high BIM engagement contractors indicate above-

average preference for the following:
• Multi-trade coordination (82% compared with the 

average of 60% for all contractors)

• Modeling for constructability evaluation (46% 

compared with 34%) 

• determining quantities from a model (39% versus 

average of 30%)

■■ Schedule (4d) and cost (5d) integration rate among 
the top three most important with over a quarter 
of contractors (29% and 24%, respectively). These 
activities are likely to grow as the technical and 
interoperability challenges of integrating model data 
with contractors’ legacy scheduling and costs systems 
become easier to manage. 

■■ General contractors are most above average in their 
preference for visualization of design intent (55% 
compared with an average of 52% for all contractors), 
likely because they are responsible for all the build 
team’s accurate understanding of the project. 
■■ trade contractors are most above average in 

determining quantities from a model (49% compared 
with an average of 30% of all contractors), which makes 
sense because it relates directly to their responsibilities. 

■■ Large contractors are most above average in their 

preference for multi-trade coordination (70% compared 
with the average of 60%) and virtual jobsite planning 
and logistics (30% compared with the average of 23%), 
probably because the value of these activities is most 
evident on larger, more complex projects.

BIM Activities by Region
Contractors show variety across regions in their 
designations of important pre-construction phase BiM 
activities. The chart at right shows the highest and lowest 
results for the top five activities.
■■ the 57 percentage point range in the regional 

responses for multi-trade coordination is unusually 
large, going from US-based contractors, who 
almost unanimously (82%) consider it to be a top 
pre-construction activity, to Brazil (25%) and Germany 
(28%), where it has not gained as much acceptance. 
■■ German (22%) contractors are also at the low end for 
designating visualization of the design intent as a top 
activity, versus South Korea (63%) and the UK (59%). 

some regions express the most enthusiasm for activities 
that score relatively low averages across all the countries/
regions. Please note that the chart at right only reflects 
five of the top responses, but some of the differentials 
below are less popular overall.
■■ Japan (53%), Brazil (52%), France (48%) and Germany 
(41%) designate integration with costs (5d) as a top 
activity compared to the average of 24%. 

■■ German firms (41%) far outweigh other regions for 

their enthusiasm about virtual jobsite planning and 
logistics, where the UK is second (30%) and the average 
is just 23%. 

■■ French firms (29%) are more than twice as positive as 

average (13%) about laser scanning to capture existing 
conditions, and Japanese contractors (13%) are more 
than double the average (6%) for safety planning/
training with BIM.

The chart shows how many contractors selected specific 
construction-phase BiM activities as being among the top 
three that best enable their organizations to leverage BiM 
data effectively.

BIM Activities That Reduce Rework
the explosive growth and value of model-driven layout 
in the field is shown clearly in its top ranking among all 
contractors. This correlates directly with the consistently 
top-rated BiM benefit of reduced rework, by leveraging 
the precision of laser guided instrumentation and the 
granular accuracy of the model to prevent errors in 
physical location of work-put-in-place, such as sleeves 
and penetration in slabs, or embeds for attachment of 
building envelope elements.

The other field-based BiM activities, augmented 

reality, laser scanning for validation of work in place, GPs 
control of construction equipment and model-driven 
robotics, all scored lower in this research, but each is 
also directly tied to the powerful benefit of reducing 
rework, so all of them can be expected to show increased 
popularity in future studies as they become more widely 
available, understood and used.

Model-Driven Prefabrication
Model-driven prefabrication is the second most widely 
selected activity by contractors, with 43% placing it 
among their top activities that help them effectively 
leverage BIM. Model-driven prefabrication is well estab-
lished as a highly beneficial BiM activity with profound 
impacts on cost, schedule, productivity and quality. 
Currently most popular with mechanical, electrical, 
plumbing and structural trades, the creation of increas-
ingly larger and more complex assemblies at offsite 
facilities that provide safer, more controlled environ-
ments at lower labor cost will continue to expand to 
include many other project elements. Premanufactured 
bathroom pods, for instance, are becoming common on 
healthcare projects in the us, and the practice is spread-
ing to other countries as more teams acknowledge their 
efficiency and quality. 

ultimately, the combination of computer-controlled 

production equipment with detailed fabrication-level 
models will enable mass customization such that most of 
the elements required to assemble a project will be avail-
able from factories rather than constructed onsite from 
raw materials. More information on this topic is available 
in McGraw hill Construction’s 2011 Prefabrication and 
Modularization SmartMarket Report.

Business-Oriented BIM Activities
The business-oriented BiM activities, status/progress 
monitoring and supply chain management, are still 
developing, but many of the software companies 
with existing tools for these activities are working on 
integrating BiM data so that their customers can leverage 
BiM for improved timeliness and accuracy. Therefore,  
it is reasonable to expect that the percentage of 
contractors rating these as top activities will increase in 
future research. 

Variation by Level of BIM Engagement
in most cases the contractors with a very high BiM engage-
ment level show above-average preference for these 
construction-phase BiM activities. This is especially true 
for model-driven prefabrication, where 61% of the most 
engaged BiM users rate it among their top three activities 
versus the average of 43% across all contractors. 

Top Construction Phase BIM Activities 
by Region
regional differences appear in the responses from 
contractors about their designations of the three most 
valuable BiM activities during construction. 
■■ South Korean contractors lead the other regions in 

their support of model-driven layout in the field, rein-
forcing the rapidly growing use of BiM in that market. 
interestingly it is also very strongly cited in Brazil, one  
of the newer areas for BiM, again highlighting this  
activity’s relative ease of deployment and immediate 
value in avoiding costly rework and enhancing  
onsite productivity.

■■ Model-driven prefabrication is highly valued in 

Canada, where many contractors report using BiM on 
non-building work, suggesting that they are actively 
leveraging models to prefabricate on those projects.
■■ German firms, who show the least interest in two of 
the three leading construction phase BIM activities, 
indicate top preference for augmented reality (47%) and 
laser scanning (44%), indicating their focus on advanced 
BiM activities during construction. 

■■ French and UK contractors show the most interest for 
status/progress monitoring, the one business-related 
activity in the top five. This may be influenced by the 
fact that BiM has been in the market for the longest time 
in europe, and contractors have had more opportunity 
to develop procedures for this activity.

one of the biggest untapped BiM business opportunities 
for contractors relates to models for owners that facilitate 
ongoing operations and maintenance. Contractors are in 
the ideal position to modify, create and manage models as 
an entirely new service with decades of potential revenue.
the fundamental task of converting one or more 
models originally intended for design, fabrication or 
construction into a format that accurately shows exactly 
what was actually built for owners ranks as the top post-
construction activity for contractors. it is an especially 
common practice among contractors at a very high BiM 
engagement level, where almost all (95%) say they have 
moderate or high involvement versus the average of 64% 
among all contractors.

Enriching the model with maintenance and operation 

data to make it more useful to owners is the next most 
popular activity, where again the very high BiM engage-
ment contractors (59%) are above the average (49%) for 
their level of involvement. 

using the model to close out a project is not quite  
as common yet, although its above-average involvement 
by very high BiM engagement contractors (57% versus 
the average of 44%) indicates it will probably grow  
in popularity. 

The new service opportunity to maintain a model for 
an owner is still emerging as a practice with less than a 
third (31%) moderately or highly involved. The business 
model for this practice has to be further developed and 
standards for maintenance need to be established before 
it will be widely practiced. 

Top Post-Construction Phase BIM 
Activities by Region
There are wide regional differences in this still-
developing category of activities.
■■ Japanese and French contractors lead among all the 

regions for most involvement in post-construction BIM 
activities, with South Korean firms (77%) taking a slight 
lead over Japanese (73%) on preparing as-built models. 

■■ the large percentage point ranges between the 

highest and lowest regions for these activities speak to 
their emerging nature, where some regions are barely 
participating and others are strongly involved.

Because post-construction BiM activities are a new and 
emerging field, there is still significant debate about 
where the business value can be found. Contractors were 
asked to identify which of the four post-construction 
activities studied in this research provides the most value. 
■■ about four in 10 (39%) assign the greatest value to 

adding maintenance and operations data to models 
for the owner. General contractors (41%) are somewhat 
more likely than average to hold this opinion, which is 
probably a result of their responsibility for aggregating 
and turning over all this information to owners at project 
completion, traditionally in paper format. 

■■ trade contractors (41%) find greater than average (29%) 
benefit from the final as-built model, perhaps because 
many of them are involved long term in servicing what 
they have installed and they appreciate the accuracy 
and usefulness of an as-built model. 

Regional Differences in the Relative 
Value of Post-Construction BIM 
Activities
Perspectives among regions vary on the value of post-
construction BiM activities, with no one region emerging 
as a consistent champion across all activities.
■■ although more South Korean contractors see top 

value in the final as-built model (39%) and using BIM 
for closeout (32%) than any other region, they are last 
in their support of adding maintenance data (25%) and 
managing the model for owners beyond closeout (3%).

■■ Canadian contractors (53%) are most in favor of 

adding maintenance data to a model, but they are in 
the bottom two for both as-built modeling (16%) and 
managing a model for an owner after closeout (5%). 
■■ australia and New Zealand contractors place second 

in valuing adding maintenance data to a model but are 
least enthusiastic about using BIM during closeout. 
Similarly, Brazil, which places second for contractors 
praising BIM for closeout, is second to last as it relates 
to adding maintenance data to a model.

another indication of the early-stage nature of post-
construction BiM activities is the absence of a difference 
of opinion between contractors with very high BiM 
engagement and those with low BiM engagement, a 
variance that is consistent among the more established 
BiM activities. This speaks to the lack of experience with 
post-construction BiM activities that even the most 
engaged contractors have to draw on in order to make a 
value judgment.

Specialized BIM Activities for Sustainability 

The use of BiM to support sustainability goals is 
increasingly valuable. Tools for analysis and simulation 
are helping design professionals to generate higher-
performing design solutions, and contractors can 
leverage models in a variety of ways to improve the 
quality and reduce the environmental impact of their 
work. in addition, an emerging area of BiM activity relates 
to owners using models to improve building performance 
by optimizing facilities management. 

Contractors identified sustainability-related BiM 

activities they engage in either often or always.
■■ almost two thirds (60%) of contractors are leveraging 
BIM to coordinate systems with the goal of improving 
energy performance, with high (67%) and very high 
(68%) BIM engagement firms doing it somewhat more 
than average.

■■ BIM for building performance in facilities management 
is a much more common practice among very high BIM 
engagement contractors (55%) than the average (44%), 
and appears to be taking hold in Brazil (57%) and France 
(55%) more than other regions. 

■■ Prefabrication to create tighter building envelopes is 

less frequent overall (39%), but large companies (45%) 
exhibit an above-average involvement, and South 
Korean and French firms (57% and 55%, respectively) 
show leadership in this area. 

■■ although using BIM to manage waste more sustainably 
is the least practiced (23%) by all contractors, it scores 
more strongly with trade contractors (30%), perhaps 
because they have the greatest ability to impact 
material waste.

Computers
Providing computers for field staff to use in the job trailer 
is almost a universal practice for contractors in france 
(97%), japan (87%) and Germany (85%), as well as among 
contractors with a very high BiM engagement level (86%) 
across all regions. 

Wireless Handheld Devices 
Mobile devices are increasingly popular among 
contractors, so the current average of 42% that report 
deploying them often or always is certain to increase, 
especially as screen resolution and connection 
bandwidth improve. as a leading indicator of that trend, 
63% of very high BiM engagement level contractors are 
currently deploying them that frequently. 

Onsite Computers (Kiosks)
kiosks on the site with computers and wireless 
connectivity are less often used (31% average), but they 
can be an effective productivity enhancement because 
they combine normal screen size with the benefit of 
bringing the model to where the work is taking place. 
This allows them to engage field workers quickly and 
efficiently. as a new approach, their frequency of use is 
distributed fairly evenly across contractors at all levels 
of BiM engagement. among regions, the electronics-
oriented japanese take a prominent lead, with 84% 
deploying jobsite BiM kiosks often or always, five times 
the rate in the us where they are still relatively rare (17%). 

Large or Multi-Screen Displays
large or multi-screen displays in the job trailer (also 
sometimes known as “BiM caves”) are an exciting new 
method of immersive engagement with the model. Most 
commonly used in france (62%), Germany (62%) and 
japan (60%), they require greater investment, but can 
facilitate much more effective communication by taking 
advantage of the powerful visualization capability of BiM.

Projects 
BiM has the most chance of being successful and 
effective when the project owner actively wants the 
project team to use it, and the number of owners 
demanding BiM on their projects is growing worldwide. 
This includes government agencies in many countries 
and an increasing number of healthcare, educational and 
commercial owners in markets such as retail, hospitality 
and corporate office buildings. These owner-driven BiM 
mandate programs have been effective for introducing 
the benefits of BiM to a large number of design and 
construction firms, many of whom become active BiM 
users thereafter with their other clients and project 
teams, driving BiM even wider through the industry.
General contractors were asked how frequently 

owners are demanding BiM in their market. The following 
commentary reflects a combined percentage of those 
that gave responses of often or always. The use of 
combined respones of often and always also applies to all 
the other data on how team members influence the use of 
BiM by firms throughout this article.
■■ More than a third (39%) of general contractors report 

that owners are either often or always demanding BIM, 
with Germany (90%) reporting the highest percentage. 
■■ the percentage of general contractors in the UK (23%) 
currently reporting high frequency of owner mandates 
is well below the average, but they should increase 
dramatically as the government BIM mandates go into 
effect in the coming years.

■■ Over half (56%) of the very high BIM engagement level 
general contractors are experiencing a great deal of 
owner demand for BIM, probably because these firms 
are working with the most BIM-intensive owners.

Contractors’ Voluntary Use of BIM
a growing number of contractors are using  
BiM voluntarily.
■■ the majority of general contractors (56%) say they 

often or always use BIM voluntarily, although fewer 
trade contractors (38%) are committed at that level, 
pointing to the need to grow BIM engagement among 
those companies. 

■■ French general contractors lead all regions in this 
category, with three quarters (74%) citing their 
voluntary commitment to BIM on most projects. 

■■ Other above-average regions for general contractors 

include established BIM markets like the US (66%) and 
the UK (65%), and also Brazil (63%), where it would 
appear that the relatively recent introduction of BIM is 
gaining advocates quickly. 

■■ Not surprisingly, most very high BIM engagement level 

■■ Canada (30%), Japan (33%) and South Korea (37%) 

firms use BIM voluntarily, including 94% of general 
contractors and 83% of trade contractors, with 61% 
of general contractors saying they always do so, 
demonstrating complete commitment to BIM.

Contractors’ Perspectives on Project team BIM Practices

Contractors’ Development of Models 
With Internal Resources
Many contractors are building internal modeling 
staffs and committing to investments in software, 
hardware and training to create models, either when 
they are not available from design professionals or for 
specific purposes such as coordination, prefabrication, 
sequencing or constructability evaluation.

Contractors were asked how frequently they create 

models with internal resources. 
■■ Over three quarters (79%) of general contractors and 

over two thirds (67%) of trade contractors at a very high 
BIM engagement level frequently build models with 
internal resources. 

■■ among regions, general contractors in Brazil (69%), 

australia (67%) and France (57%) show above-average 
commitment to building models, along with half (50%) 
of the trade contractors in the US. 

Contractors Receipt of Models From 
Design Professionals
Contractors frequently must conduct BiM activities 
without receiving models from design professionals. 
This is because many designers are still not using BiM, 
and some of the ones that do are reluctant to share their 
models with contractors, in both cases creating the 
inefficient need for extra work by the contractor.
■■ Very high BIM engagement contractors are more 

frequently receiving models from designers, with trade 
contractors from that group (75%) more successful 
than general contractors (62%), both of which  
greatly surpass the average of only 46% across all 
levels of engagement. 

■■ Japanese general contractors (67%) take a strong lead 
regionally, perhaps providing a model for success that 
can be copied in other regions. 

General Contractors’ Practices With 
Trade Contractors
in all McGraw hill Construction’s research around the 
world, the top reason given for not adopting BiM is that 
no one has asked the company to do it. a growing prac-
tice everywhere is for general contractors to ask trade 
contractors to be responsible for developing models for 
their part of the work. This requirement has been a major 
driver for BiM adoption among trades, and its contin-
ued growth as a BiM practice will also drive deeper BiM 
engagement among the companies that adopt.

general contractors most frequently demand models 
from the trade contractors on their projects, and 
German and French firms also lead in receiving models 
without demanding them (55% and 50%, respectively). 
this reflects more well-established inter-company 
practices in these regions where BIM has been used for 
a long time.

■■ Very high BIM engagement firms are significantly more 
active in these practices than average, indicating that 
modeling by trade contractors is a trend the rest of the 
market is likely to follow.

Trade Contractors’ Modeling Practices
The number of trade contractors that are actively 
modeling varies greatly by geography and across 
specialties. although the ultimate goal is for all trades 
to be modeling their work on all projects everywhere, 
it is not uncommon currently for only one trade to be 
producing models on a project.

one quarter (25%) of trade contractors across all 
regions in this research indicated that they are either 
often or always the only trade modeling, still representing 
a large proportion of the industry. a third (31%) claim 
it rarely or never happens, and a similar amount (36%) 
say that most of the major trades are often or always 
modeling on their projects, a positive trend that needs  
to accelerate.

BIM Activities and Practices 

continued

Using the Cloud 

all business software users around the world are 
exploring ways to use offsite servers for hosting large 
amounts of data and the applications that work with it, all 
of which is generally referred to as putting these things in 
“the cloud.” 

Construction Companies’ Use of  
the Cloud
Contractors are no exception to this trend, and while this 
research shows that no more than half the respondents 
on average are currently using the cloud for project or 
business activities, the shift from desktop and enterprise 
to cloud-based services is certain to continue.
■■ as a leading indicator of that change, contractors 

currently at the very high BIM engagement level are 
already significantly more active in the cloud than the 
overall average. 

■■ More general contractors are frequently using the 

cloud than trade contractors for project activities (52% 
versus 41%), hosting models (47% versus 30%) and 
company business activities (39% versus 26%).
■■ Large contractors are 50% to 100% more highly 
involved in all these cloud activities than small 
companies, likely because the larger companies have 
more skilled information technology staff to help guide 
and manage this transformative initiative. 

Contractors’ Concerns About Security 
of the Cloud
security of the information hosted in the cloud is a 
growing issue. Overall, 62% of the contractors surveyed 
expressed a moderate or high level of concern. 
■■ South Korean contractors (79%) top the list, while 
japanese (43%) and German (31%) firms seem to  
worry the least. 

■■ two thirds of general contractors (63%) express 

moderate to high concern, compared with half (50%) of 
trade contractors, which reflects general contractors’ 
greater level of responsibility for large amounts of 
sensitive project information. 

■■ Not surprisingly, the very high (72%) and high (70%) 
BIM engagement level firms express greater than 
average concern. 

as more firms engage the collaborative benefits of BiM, 
the industry will need to address issues of security, as 
well as bandwidth, mobile access, latency and new 
usage-based business models.

BIM and Field Data: How Detailed Field 
Conditions Are Creating Better 3D Models

The promise of field-accurate information inside a 3D Building Information 
Model is rapidly becoming a useful reality on construction sites and 
in early design discussions, thanks to better software-importing 
capabilities and newer, less-expensive field-scanning technologies.

T hanks to faster data 

connections and capital 
investments in storage 
capacity and equipment, 

construction managers are using 
laser scanning as a BiM-enabled, 
whole-project verification tool. 

Investments in Laser 
Scanning 
Previously the purview of surveyors, 
a “scan” is a powerful laser recording 
of field data that captures a site’s 
shapes, and possibly its appearance, 
and converts those conditions 
into a cloud of data points that can 
be uploaded into a 3D BiM. last 
august, Providence, rhode island-
based Gilbane Building Company 
purchased a faro focus 3D laser 
scanner. Counting software and 
operations training, the bill came in 
around $60,000, a far cry from the 
six-figure cost of older scanners, but 
still a major investment.

“We’ve found that laser scanning 

has a huge barrier to entry in cost, 
but if you own it, you find use cases 
for it that you otherwise wouldn’t 
have considered,” said john Tocci, 
jr., director of virtual design and 
construction at Gilbane. “on one 
project, 30 minutes of scan time in 
the field and 30 minutes of post-
processing and uploading the  
point cloud into a revit model  
saved $30,000.”

Using Laser Scans in BIM 
for Prefabrication
Tocci said Gilbane has seen both 
cost savings and major field safety 
improvements from importing 
laser scans into revit models. 
Prefabrication and coordination of 
mechanical, electrical and plumbing 
(MeP) systems installation has saved 
rework money on every project on 
which Gilbane has used its scanner. 
Prefabrication of ductwork and 
systems has eliminated field work 
and stopped what might have been 
weeks of MeP rough-in activities.

one such project was the 

renovation of kreger hall at Miami 
university in oxford, ohio. The 
85-year-old building will become 
the new home of Miami’s Physics 
Department when the renovation is 
completed next year. The original 
plans were a hand-drawn set. By 
laser-scanning 50,000 square feet 
of the building in one day, Gilbane’s 
virtual design and construction 
(VDC) staff was able to get accurate 
measurements for prefabrication, 
scheduling and sequencing of 
the $12 million upgrade that will 
turn the existing building into labs 
and physics lecture halls. Gilbane 
was able to drive the entire MeP, 
structural and building coordination 
activities on the project from a  
3D model.

“it would have been an unrealistic 

expectation to believe trade 
contractors could go in and come 
out cleanly and install everything 
the first time based on ancient 2D 

documents,“ Tocci said. “The scan 
gives them that level of reliability.  
The value to the project from 
prefabrication and site knowledge 
on that project alone will exceed six 
figures. if someone is telling us from 
finished floor to underside of beam, 
you have 11-feet, eight inches, we can 
say, ‘no we have 11 feet even.’”

Network and Hardware 
Requirements
like similar big data solutions, your 
network and hardware need to be 
up to the task to share and upload 
the point-cloud data. Gilbane has a 
primary server with three terabytes 
of storage and a secondary server 
that has 16 terabytes. Computers 
with 32 GB of raM, high-end 
graphics cards and solid-state hard 
drives are also necessary. it’s not 
unusual to have a point cloud take 
up more than 200 GB of hard drive 
space. To share these data sets, 
Gilbane’s outbound network traffic 
can generate 65 GB of network 
activity in a single day. 

Gilbane’s initial uses—five projects 

across the us spanning higher 
education renovations to work for 
the national institutes of health in 
Washington, D.C.—have generated 
such a value-add that they’re 
purchasing a second laser scanner 
this year. The VDC group is hoping 
to add the faro focus3D X 330 to its 
laser-scanning tool kit for long-range 
outdoor scans. n

Data: 

North America

BIM for Construction Data From  
Contractors in Canada and the United States

Contractors in North America are far more advanced at BIM use compared 
with those in other parts of the world, and they are planning to invest in 
increasing the depth of use. Of particular importance is collaboration of owners 
as well as improving process outcomes and reducing errors and omissions. 

BIM Engagement
There are three components that 
comprise the BiM engagement level 
(see page 14): experience with BiM, 
expertise level and implementation 
level—shown at right. 

Compared with those in the 
other regions, contractors in the us 
and Canada are notably higher in 
expertise, translating to 20% being at 
the very high engagement level. 

Project Types
in north america, BiM is used most 
heavily on building projects. specif-
ically, us contractors are extremely 
heavily engaged in BiM on institu-
tional and government buildings. in 
Canada, there is more use of BiM on 
infrastructure projects (see page 31). 

ROI on BIM
overall, 76% of north american 
contractors rate positive roi on 
BiM, with more than a quarter rating 
it at a very high level. however, a 
nearly comparable level rate it as 
break-even/negative. This lack of 
agreement may be due to the high 
share that are not engaging in any 
formal measurement of roi—41% in 
Canada and 43% in the us. 

The average for the north 
american contractors match the 
overall average for the factors 
deemed the most important to 
improve roi. however, individually, 
there are some differences: 
■■ Improved project process 

outcomes and improved productiv-
ity of personnel: higher in the us at

Investments
investments deemed as important 
for us contractors are consistent 
with the average of all respondents. 
however, overall, investments in

BiM processes. 

Top Benefits
There are some differences among 
the north american contractors 
(averages for all north american 
contractors shown at right). in 
the us, marketing new business,

more. (see pages 19–22.) 

Top Activities

Pre-ConstruCtion
a high percentage of us contractors 
use BiM in multi-trade coordination 
(82%), visualization of design

Data: 

Brazil

BIM for Construction Data From  
Contractors in Brazil

Brazilian contractors are newer to using BIM. However, they are reporting 
plans to invest in building capabilities and expertise, and expect to increase 
activity levels in the future. Of particular importance in this country are the 
cost benefits BIM can yield—including improved ability to predict costs.

BIM Engagement
There are three components that 
comprise the BiM engagement level 
(see page 14): experience with BiM, 
expertise level and implementation 
level—shown at right. 

Compared with those in the other 

regions, contractors in Brazil are 
much newer BiM users, translating 
to a low BiM engagement index for 
55% of contractors in the country and 
none at the very high level. 

Project Types
for the most part, contractors in 
Brazil are using BiM on lower levels 
of project types, likely reflecting 
more specialized use of BiM versus 
contractors using BiM on many 
project types. The exception is 
industrial/manufacturing, where 31% 
are using BiM, compared with 32% 
for all respondents (see page 31). 

ROI on BIM
in Brazil, 85% of contractors report a 
positive roi on BiM. and the share 
that report very positive roi (36%) 
is equivalent to other key countries 
investigated in this study. however, 
this high level is likely speculative, 
since 35% of firms are not formally 
measuring BiM roi (see page 24). 
The top three business benefits 

that would help drive increased 
roi in Brazil line up against those 
for all regions investigated, though 
improved productivity of personnel 
is rated more highly (see page 26).

Planned BIM 
Investments
Developing internal collaborative 
BiM processes, BiM software and 
BiM training are investment areas 
that Brazilian contractors note as 
high/very high in importance. These 
are all areas that correspond to the 
relatively newer level of BiM use, 
since they reflect the need for these 
firms to build internal BiM capacity 
and expertise. 

Top Benefits
Generally, contractors in Brazil match 
up against the benefits most often 
cited by other contractors around the 
world (see chart at right as well as 
pages 20–23), though sometimes at 
different priority levels. 

for example, in process bene-
fits, the top two benefits are reversed 
with significantly more Brazilian 
contractors rating cost controls/
predictability as a key benefit, 
compared with all respondents 
around the world where collabora-
tion with owners is more often cited 
as a benefit. similarly, for project 
benefits, reduced costs ranks higher 
than reduced errors and omissions. 

Top Activities

Pre-ConstruCtion
integration of model with schedule 
(4D) and with cost (5D) are used 
by significantly more Brazilian 
contractors compared with all 
respondents. use of 4D is reported 
by 72% Brazilian firms, and use of  
5D is reported by 52%—compared 
with only 29% and 24%, respectively, 
for all respondents. The results 
reinforce the importance of using 
BiM for cost control.

BIM for Construction Data From  
Contractors in France, Germany and the UK

Contractors in France, Germany and the UK are currently at relatively low 
BIM engagement levels, but they are planning activities and investments to 
increase usage. The benefits and activities vary across the different countries, 
pointing to markets that are unique, versus consensus across Europe. 

BIM Engagement
There are three components that 
comprise the BiM engagement level 
(see page 14): experience with BiM, 
expertise level and implementation 
level—shown at right.

regions, the european contractors 
are notably higher in both newer 
users and those at a beginner exper-
tise level. implementation and 
engagement levels are relatively 
consistent across the three nations, 
though france is a little higher.

Project Types
in the uk, BiM is used most heavily 
on all building projects—at higher 
rates than contractors in other 
regions. in france and Germany, the 
emphasis is on commercial and resi-
dential buildings, with far fewer using 
BiM on government-owned build-
ings. (see page 31 for more detail.) 

ROI on BIM
overall, 80% of contractors in these 
european countries report positive 
roi on BiM, though those in the uk 
pull down the average, with french 
and German contractors among the 
most positive (see page 23).

The averages for the european 
contractors for factors that improve 
roi match against other nations. 
however, individually, there are 
differences in each of the countries:

Data: 

South Korea

BIM for Construction Data From  
Contractors in South Korea

Though at a relatively low implementation level of BIM use currently, 
contractors in South Korea are preparing for more intense use in the future, 
as they look to make investments in internal BIM expertise and processes to 
encourage it. Improved communication and collaboration, as well as reduced 
errors, are important benefits and drivers to increasing engagement.  

BIM Engagement
There are three components that 
comprise the BiM engagement level 
(see page 14): experience with BiM, 
expertise level and implementation 
level—shown at right. 

Compared with those in the other 
regions, contractors in south korea 
are using BiM on fewer projects, 
leading to 78% of them being at low 
or medium engagement levels. 

Project Types
Most of the south korean 
contractors’ BiM use is being done 
on buildings, particularly commercial 
and government-owned ones. levels 
for use in non-building projects is 
comparable with the total for all 
respondents (see page 31). 

ROI on BIM
in south korea, only 48% report 
a positive roi on BiM, which is 
the lowest for all the key countries 
investigated in this study. The 
relatively low usage of BiM on 
projects and the lack of formal 
measurement of roi (39% are not 
formally measuring BiM roi on any 
projects) could be reasons for this 
low result.

overwhelmingly, south korean 

contractors agree that the factor 
that would have the most impact 
on improving roi for BiM is better 
multi-party communications and 
understanding—91% versus 60%  
for all respondents (see page 26). 
This consensus does not exist in 
other markets.

Planned BIM 
Investments
BiM training and developing 
collaborative processes are 
investment areas in which south 
korean contractors place high/very 
high importance. The agreement as 
to the importance of BiM training 
makes a strong statement about 
the future plans for BiM use in the 
country, as firms prepare all their 
workers to become users. 

Top Benefits
overall, the top benefits reported 
by contractors in south korea align 
with the total for all respondents. 
Though second for both respondents 
in south korea and in total, 
marketing new business is noted 
by significantly more contractors in 
south korea. similarly, the reduction 
of errors and omissions is viewed as 
a top benefit for significantly more 
contractors in south korea. 

Top Activities

Pre-ConstruCtion
overall, the current ways contractors 
are leveraging BiM in south korea 
are comparable to those of all 
respondents (see page 32), with 
particularly strong use of BiM for 
multi-trade coordination (65%), 
visualization of the design intent 
(63%) and determining quantities 
from models (43%). 

ConstruCtion and 
Post-ConstruCtion
overall, similar numbers of 
contractors in south korea are 
using BiM for construction and post-
construction activities compared with 
all respondents (see pages 34–36).

Data: 

Japan

BIM for Construction Data From  
Contractors in Japan

Japanese contractors are engaging in BIM at moderate levels but are reporting 
significant benefits from doing so. This should help spur increased usage, as 
should the investments oriented toward building capacity for and expertise 
in BIM. Higher profits and lower costs are key factors to BIM use in Japan.

BIM Engagement
There are three components that 
comprise the BiM engagement level 
(see page 14): experience with BiM, 
expertise level and implementation 
level—shown at right. 

Compared with those in the other 

regions, contractors in japan are at 
more moderate BiM engagement 
levels, with 83% having used BiM for 
more than three years, and nearly 
three quarters (74%) using BiM on 
15%–60% of projects.

Project Types
Most of the japanese contractors’ 
BiM use is being done on commercial 
buildings and industrial/manufactur-
ing projects, with the other sectors 
rating lower usage compared with 
other respondents around the world 
(see page 31). 

ROI on BIM
in japan, nearly all contractors report 
a positive roi on BiM. further, the 
share that report very positive roi 
(40%) is higher than the percentage 
reporting the same in any other 
region. More japanese contractors 
are also formally measuring BiM 
roi on projects compared with 
respondents in most other regions.
The top business benefits that 
would help drive increased roi in 
japan line up against those for all 
regions investigated, though lower 
project cost is significantly higher 
in japan at 55% versus 29% for all 
respondents (see page 26).

japanese contractors place high/
very high importance. These areas 
all correspond to the moderate level 
of BiM engagement, since these are 
investments related to building inter-
nal capacity to accelerate BiM use. 

Top Benefits
Marketing new business and 
increased profits are the top reported 
internal BiM benefits for japanese 
contractors, at levels greater than for 
all respondents. Conversely, signif-
icantly fewer cite enhancing your 
organization’s image as a top benefit 
(see page 20), which may be repre-
sentative of the japanese culture as 
well as of moderate BiM users. 
The top process benefits for 
japanese contractors align with all 
respondents, though collaboration 
is noted by far fewer contractors in 
japan. in contrast, reduced overall 
project duration is noted as a project 
benefit by far more firms in japan.

Data: 

Australia and New Zealand

BIM for Construction Data From  
Contractors in Australia and New Zealand

Contractors in Australia and New Zealand, though relatively new users of BIM 
compared with contractors in some other parts of the world, are reporting important 
benefits from BIM and planning future investments, particularly in areas that 
extend to accelerating use of BIM across project teams, especially owners. 

BIM Engagement
There are three components that 
comprise the BiM engagement level 
(see page 14): experience with BiM, 
expertise level and implementation 
level—shown at right. 

Compared with those in the other 
regions, contractors in australia and 
new Zealand are slightly newer BiM 
users, which results in their relatively 
lower engagement levels—though 
the difference is not dramatic. 

Project Types
for the most part, contractors in 
australia and new Zealand are 
using BiM on the same projects as 
contractors in other regions. notable 
exceptions are commercial buildings, 
industrial/manufacturing and mining 
projects where BiM is used at signifi-
cantly higher rates (see page 31). 

ROI on BIM
in australia and new Zealand, 78% 
of contractors report a positive roi 
on BiM, and  those that report very 
positive roi (35%) is equivalent to 
other key countries investigated in 
this study. 

Two of the top three business 

benefits that would help drive 
increased roi in australia and new 
Zealand line up against those for all 
regions investigated. however, in 
australia and new Zealand, using 
BiM for sustainability goals is rated 
as an important benefit by twice as 
many contractors than globally—32% 
compared with 16%, respectively.

Planned BIM 
Investments
external collaborative BiM processes 
and interoperability are investment 
areas where contractors in australia 
and new Zealand place higher 
importance, which corresponds to 
findings in the Business Value of 
BIM in Australia and New Zealand 
SmartMarket Report (2014) , which 
revealed efforts that are already 
underway to accelerate BiM 
standards and use of BiM across 
entire project teams, including 
owners. new and upgraded desktop 
machines is also an area of high 
planned investment. 

Top Benefits
Generally, contractors in australia 
and new Zealand match up against 
the benefits most often cited by other 
contractors around the world (see 
chart at right as well as pages 20–23). 
The exception is increased profits. 

it is cited by the second highest 
number of contractors compared to 
its position as third, behind marketing 
new business, for all respondents. 

Top Activities

Pre-ConstruCtion
Visualization of the design intent and 
multi-trade coordination are cited by 
the most contractors in australia and 
new Zealand as the top ways they are 
leveraging BiM for pre-construction—
at 55% and 43%, respectively. it is 
comparable to the top for all contrac-
tors (see page 32), though in reversed 
order. integration of model with cost 
(5D) and with schedule (4D) and safety 
are also used by more contractors in 
this region.

Asia: Emerging BIM Market Driven by Owner 
Interest in China, Hong Kong and Malaysia 

Valued at well over $1 trillion in 2012, China’s construction market has the 
potential to see immense benefits from BIM, but structural obstacles have 
caused that potential to remain largely untapped. Comparisons to BIM use 
in Hong Kong and Malaysia provide insight into China’s unique challenges.

China

Still a NaSceNt Market 
for BiM
only a small percentage of firms in 
the Chinese market are currently 
using BiM, according to a survey 
conducted in 2012 and published in 
March 2013 by the China Construc-
tion industry association (CCia). li 
fei, secretary general of the CCia, 
explains that the survey revealed 
that “actual BiM implementation 
is still in the early stages, with less 
than 15% [of the 388 Chinese con-
struction firms that participated in 
the research] indicating they have 
used BiM.“ however, the study also 
showed that 55% have heard of BiM. 
This awareness will be a crucial first 
step toward wider BiM adoption.
one aspect of adoption of BiM 
in China that differs from markets 
with earlier adoption is that contrac-
tors are the largest group of adopt-
ers, vastly outnumbering designers 
and owners. Dr. li Yungui, deputy 
director of the Technical Center of 
China state Construction engineer-
ing Corporation limited, one of the 
largest construction companies in 
the world, states that, “for design-
ers, BiM adoption is more challeng-
ing.” among the reasons for this 
challenge, he notes that, “from a 
designer’s perspective, using BiM is 
often considered extra work within a 
fixed fee. This extra cost may include 
buying software and investing in the 
training of staff. While the additional 
technical skill may help designers to 
beat out the competition in winning 

projects, the abundance of avail-
able projects in the Chinese market 
reduces the urgency of adoption.”
on the other hand, Dr. Yungui 
finds that market forces and strong 
benefits are helping drive contractors 
to adopt BiM. “Contractors in 
China are technically skilled, and 
competition between the major 
organizations is fierce. using BiM 
can help reduce costs through 
clash detection and optimization of 
construction schedules, allowing 
organizations to not only win 
contracts, but earn more from each 
contract.” however, he also notes 
that only a few have the prerequisite 
skills to use BiM currently, which may 
help explain the relatively low use of 
BiM across the industry. 

key oBStacleS to BiM 
adoptioN iN chiNa
he Xixing, general manager of 
shanghai jianke engineering Con-
sulting Company, ltd., a project man-
agement firm employing over 3,000 
people, finds that his company has 
needed to adopt BiM, but he rec-
ognizes many structural barriers 
in the market. “Breaking with tra-
ditional methods can be difficult,” 
he explains. “new developments 
in BiM will conflict with benefits of 
traditional stakeholder roles and 
values. for example, when we sug-
gest the use of BiM for clash detec-
tion and MeP coordination, the GCs 
feel that we are threatening their 
familiar workflow. Typically, GCs like 
to submit a low bid then cut costs 
during the construction process. The 

high degree of transparency inherent 
in BiM projects can reduce the flexi-
bility available to GCs during project 
delivery. This makes BiM adoption 
difficult in a market that is driven by 
the demand and ideology of GCs.”

fei agrees, noting that a key barrier 

to BiM adoption is that it “requires 
altering typical management pro-
cesses, which frequently results in 
some level of resistance.” 

Dr. Yungui reveals that legal 
requirements in the construction 
market work against collaboration, 
which therefore inhibits the use 
of BiM. “for projects in China, the 
rfP for design and construction is 
required to be separate—the law 
states that the design stage cannot 
involve contractors, so there is 
less opportunity of collaboration 
through BiM.” Without the ability to 
capitalize on the transparency of BiM 
and its effectiveness in supporting 
collaboration, the Chinese market 
may struggle to see the full benefits 
BiM can provide.

With only 13% of designers who 
have reported using BiM, compared 
with over 50% of contractors, accord-
ing to the survey published by CCia, 
the lack of interoperability in soft-
ware is also a notable problem. 
Xixing states, “another challenge is 
that the software available in China is 
not yet able to easily support model-
ing efforts at sufficient levels of detail 
and accuracy required for analytic 
and management model uses. such 
modeling requires significant invest-
ment and is rather inefficient. one

example is the Tianjin 117 Tower 
project, where the lDi is using BiM 
but has separated BiM from the 
design team. Therefore, this requires 
extra time where the model is 
lagging behind the actual design.

Dr. Yungui, Xixing and fei all agree 

that lack of human capital is also a 
critical factor impacting adoption in 
China currently. Dr. Yungui states, 
“We are not seeing enough people 
who know about the software.” 
however, Xixing finds that the 
human capital problem goes beyond 
just the software to other key skills: 
“finding adequately trained staff 
to support BiM processes is critical. 
first, team members operating 
BiM need to have the skills and 
capabilities of using the technology. 
second, they must also have a good 
understanding of construction 
processes. Third, users of BiM 
need good project management 
capabilities to work well as a team. 
Very few candidates in the Chinese 
market today have this advanced 
set of capabilities.” fei reports that 
the most widely recognized step for 
future BiM adoption in the survey is 
training more BiM-capable staff. 

owNerS will drive BiM USe 
owners are likely to help drive further 
adoption of BiM. Dr. Yungui identifies 
the opportunities of facility manage-
ment, which is still largely untapped 
in more developed BiM markets like 
the us and europe, as one of the fac-
tors currently influencing BiM adop-
tion in China: “We have seen many 
Chinese owners of major projects ... 
may go as far as requesting BiM for 
facility management. oftentimes this 
is reflected in their rfP language.” he 
affirms, “Building owners/operators 
are receiving the most benefit from 
using BiM, because at the end of the 

day, it is their money.

Xixing agrees that owners seek-
ing to improve facility management 
are emerging as a key driver of adop-
tion in China. “Today, BiM is lever-
aged to connect with construction 
management, reduce waste, increase 
efficiency and support information 
transfer to the o&M phase. More and 
more, owners and project teams are 
looking toward BiM for operations 
and facilities management.” he sees 
this playing an important role in the 
future. “Many owners want us to go 
beyond managing design and con-
struction, moving into building oper-
ations and management. so now, 
BiM can be used to expand how we 
provide services to the client.”

Hong Kong
rosana Wong, executive director of 
the Yau lee Group, a large contractor 
operating in hong kong, feels 
that the hong kong market is also 

largely owner driven. she finds that 
“premium general contractors are 
the leading BiM adopters” there, but 
that BiM use is frequently “one-off 
due to unique project requirements.” 
for her, the key to growth in this 
market is “further support from 
the government, in terms of policy, 
mandates and incentives,” and she 
sees the potential for BiM-experienced 
hong kong firms to “support the 
development of the built environment 
in nearby countries and regions.”

Malaysia
khor Wei Moon, director of techni-
cal design for sunway Group, a prop-
erty development and construction 
company, finds that BiM is “mainly a 
private initiative driven by the larger 
property developers and contrac-
tors” in Malaysia. he expects that to 
continue in the future, since govern-
ment support for BiM adoption has 
been limited to training thus far. n

India: BIM Gains Relevance

As India strides to keep pace with significant gaps in its infrastructure, the 
construction sector—the second largest industry after agriculture accounting 
for 11% of India’s GDP—is crying out for efficiencies to speed productivity. 
BIM provides one opportunity to help address India’s growing needs.

I ncreasingly, larger construction 

companies in sectors such 
as hotels and airports are 
starting to implement Building 
information Modeling (BiM) in india 
with distinct benefits but at a very 
high cost.

Costs of Implementation
“it’s a chicken and egg situation. 
unless BiM is adopted on a larger 
scale, costs will continue to be 
high, trained people will remain at 
a premium, and the full potential 
of BiM technology for visualization 
and walkthrough developments 
will continue to lag,” says one 
software engineer. in fact, Tesla 
outsourcing services, an indian 
company that delivers engineering, 
CaD and BiM services to clients 
worldwide, reported in a blog 
post that, according to a report by 
autodesk, “Designers across the 
world have started implementing 
BiM technology in their respective 
construction projects; whereas their 
indian counterparts have still not 
captured the full potential of BiM 
technology for visualization and 
walkthrough developments.”
BiM technology promises 
delivery of coordinated design 
and construction information in a 
3D visual environment. however, 
as pressures on construction 
companies to deliver quality value-
added projects on time and within 
budget increase, the industry is still 
learning about BiM and how to utilize 
software to meet their needs. 

“BiM is moving slowly and is 
used for hotel projects and luxury 
buildings that have lots of electro-
mechanical requirements to avoid 
conflicts at time of construction. We 
find BiM useful as conflicts like a pipe 
going into an air-conditioning duct, 
not possible in CaD, can be seen 
visually,” says anil lal, managing 
director, systra-MVa Consulting 
india to enr. “[however] we use BiM 
only when clients mandate it.” 

Mumbai-based hCC Group, one 
of the largest companies spanning 
the engineering and construction, 
real estate, infrastructure and urban 
development sectors, does not use 
BiM much. “it is used mostly for 
buildings, which is just 5%–10% 
of our total business”, a design 
engineer told enr. “for the past 
decade, people have been using 
sTaaD [a structural analysis and 
design computer program] and 
now convert the sTaaD model 
to eTaBs [an analysis and design 
software]….[People] are (now) 
developing confidence [to use newer 
technology].” eTaBs is the solution 
for designing a simple 2D frame or 
performing a dynamic analysis of a 
complex high-rise. it can be applied 
for design of building structures  
with a structural system consisting  
of beams, slabs, columns, shear 
walls and bracings. Different 
materials can be assigned to the 
structural elements within the same 
model, such as steel, reinforced 
concrete, composite or any other 
user-defined material.

systra was recently awarded 
the construction of stations for the 
Bangalore metro system, which 
mandated BiM. “The software is 
expensive, and there aren’t enough 
trained people [which means design 
takes longer],” says lal.

uttam sagar, Ceo, development 

and construction of Bangalore- 
based Vasoo Builders, with  
projects including large commercial 
buildings, says BiM is too 
complicated and has “too much 
information for uncertain scenarios. 
The inputs required for BiM feeding 
off structural and mechanical 
drawings and then having to update 
the drawings is very difficult. 
We need a separate agency for 
implementing BiM, which comprises 
around 4%–5% of design costs. 
Margins are paper thin, so it’s not 
worth it for us.” sagar says using BiM 
for the Bangalore metro makes sense 
“because it’s a government project ... 
they can afford it and want control  
at various points.”

Factors Favoring BIM
india’s steel industry leads the way 
with BiM, as do companies supplying 
prefabricated manufactured and 
finished products. “if you dump 1000 
bags of cement at a site, it doesn’t 
matter which one goes first,” says 
Gautam suri, founder, director and 
chief technology officer, interarch 
Building Products, a company 
manufacturing pre-engineered metal 
building systems. The company has 
integrated saP with BiM inhouse

as the “BiM aspect helps you 
model the building and on time,” 
says suri. “for large projects, the 
sequence of deliveries is essential, 
and manufacturing follows a similar 
schedule…. Being in the prefab 
business, BiM is an important tool for 
us, and we couldn’t live without it.” 

interarch does not use 

standardized packages as they need 
to be customized and its “experience 
in dealing with software package 
vendors is that they get stuck in  
nitty gritties.”

Many large construction 

companies in india do not use BiM, 
though some buy a standard package 
and adapt their requirements to it. 
for instance, Punj lloyd, a large 
engineering and construction 
group that provides integrated 
design, procurement and project 
management services for energy 
and infrastructure sector projects, 
confirmed to enr it did not use BiM. 
recently, Mike Barker, managing 
director, Mott MacDonald india, 
said the company was increasingly 
looking at BiM in its construction 
projects. BiM was used in the design 
of neighboring Male international 
airport expansion in the Maldives. 
“as with all island airport projects, 
challenging aspects of this expansion 
include limited space—reclamation 
is restricted by the coral that 
surrounds the island, and problems 
of procurement, as most of the 
resources (are) imported to the site.” 
shell’s r&D Centre in Bangalore is 
also being designed with the help of 
BiM, says Barker.

International Firms 
Using BIM in India
With india’s construction market 
valued currently at $140 billion and 

a forecasted growth of $620 billion 
by 2020, new projects are being fast-
tracked, leading many international 
firms to seize the opportunity, and 
this is helping to bring BiM into the 
marketplace. Vico software, for 
instance, announced a partnership 
with Mansycom Consultants. Donald 
henrich, co-founder and executive 
vice president of Vico software, 
explains, “Because the indian market 
is so broad and diverse, we knew we 
needed a partner who is committed 
in three areas: market education, 
technology advocacy and expert 
consulting services for change 
management. We are very impressed 
with Mansycom’s commitment in 
these areas.”

autodesk announced it will provide 

its BiM software to help jurong 
Consultants india, part of singapore-
based jurong international. jurong is 
creating a design center as a means 
of enhancing its multidisciplinary 
service delivery through BiM in 
india. “We are equipping a pool of 
professionals that includes engineers, 
architects and master planners, 
to provide integrated consulting 
services for our customers …. This will 
enable us to deliver projects that are 
aligned with the pace of the building 
industry’s transformation,” says uma 
Maheswaran, Ceo, india operations, 
jurong Consultants. recently, 
Munich-based nemetschek allplan 
partnered with ram Caddsys. “in 
india, we have a dramatically growing 
construction industry particularly 
in bridge construction, power and 
hydraulic engineering, which offers 
huge potential,” says Benjamin 
hansen, director global sales for 
nemetscheck allplan. Tata Consulting 
engineers (TCel) too announced it 
will leverage BiM solutions offered 

by BiM to bring business value to 
its global customers in the power, 
infrastructure, chemical, process and 
building sectors

The Future of BIM
looking at the growing market, 
BiM software provider, Tekla india, 
recently showcased its offering 
for concrete construction projects. 
according to chief operating offi-
cer nirmalya Chatterjee, the indus-
try is starting to reap benefits. for 
instance, cast-in-place concrete has 
been a major concern for contrac-
tors, which BiM solutions address. 
The past two years have seen 
sophistication in systems bring-
ing in automatic information flow 
and control. interarch’s suri is opti-
mistic about BiM’s role in the future 
from engineering to execution even 
as more manufacturing takes place 
in facilities rather than onsite. off-
site prefabrication uses software to 
deliver sequentially and on time for 
pre-engineered steel structures for 
large buildings. Challenges in imple-
mentation remain for the time being.

“Many engineers don’t understand 

or know how to use the tool. on-the-
job training is lacking, and software-
based fabrication engineers are just 
not clued in. To start with, they need 
to learn how to use the software. 
That should take the fear of God 
away,” explains suri.

Benefits are striking and include 
less material waste, speedier com-
pletion, scheduling of risks and 
easing of logistics issues. “To handle 
(logistics) manually is cumbersome 
as india poses many constraints of 
loading material for transportation. 
With BiM, raw material is pre-identi-
fied and what goes into which truck is 
predetermined,” adds suri. n

Global Building Information Modeling (BIM) Study Research

McGraw hill Construction conducted 
the 2013 Global Building information 
Modeling (BiM) study to determine 
contractors’ use of and attitudes 
toward BiM. The research was 
conducted through an internet survey 
to contractors between september 
25th and november 5th, 2013.

a total of 727 individuals across 
10 countries completed the survey, 
recruited through a combination 
of professional association 
invitations and supplemental 
panel recruiting. The organizations 
that provided the survey to their 
members or subscribers include: 
air Conditioning and Mechanical 
Contractors association, american 
society of Professional estimators, 
association of General Contractors, 
australian Construction industry 
forum, australian institute of 
Building surveyors, BiMforum,

research and innovation in Building 
and Construction (CiB), korea 
Mechanical Construction Contractors, 
o’empreiteiro, sheet Metal and air 
Conditioning Contractors’ national 
association, uk Contractors Group, 
uk Green Building Council,  
us Green Building Council and  
World Green Building Council,  
along with Yonsei university. 

Survey Participants
The survey targeted contractors that 
use BiM. BiM use was self-reported. 
firms referred to as general con-
tractors in the analysis include those 
that identify themselves as general 
contractor, construction manager 
at risk or construction manage-
ment companies. Trade contractors 
were asked to identify their specialty 
or trade. eighty-two percent of the 
respondents are identified as general

contractors in the analysis and 18% 
as trade/specialty contractors.
The analysis throughout the 
report explores the differences in 
the responses of small, medium and 
large contractors. Those are defined 
by their annual revenue in 2012:
• Small: Less than $50 million
• Medium: $50 million to less than 

$250 million

• Large: $250 million or more

The following is the list of countries 
included and the number of 
respondents from each country:

• Australia: 83
• Brazil: 40
• Canada: 39
• France: 31
• Germany: 32
• Japan: 30
• Korea: 91
• New Zealand: 36
• United Kingdom: 54
• United States: 291

BIM Engagement Index
McGraw hill Construction has 
developed a BiM engagement 
index, which quantifies with a 
numerical score each respondent 
that participated in this research. 
The score is derived from contractor 
survey responses about their 
experiences with, expertise in and 
level of implementation of BiM. These 
responses are weighted to reflect the 
increasing level of engagement that 
is represented by more experience, 
skill and/or implementation. each of 
the three criteria is weighted against 
the others to reflect its relative degree 
of importance for BiM engagement, 
with expertise being the most 
valuable, followed by experience, 
then implementation level. for more 
information on the BiM engagement 
index, see page 14. n

adoption, usage and business value of Building 
Information Modeling (BIM). As greater 
industry demands unfold, BIM is emerging 
as a necessary process to promote leaner 
operations throughout a construction project’s 
lifecycle. Regardless of size, contractors are at 
the heart of the workflows and processes that 
see the greatest benefits from BIM. Adopters 
of BIM accrue competitive, financial and 
operational benefits with usage and mastery 
of BIM processes and technologies. This first 
Produced with support from 
Global BIM in Construction report reinforces 
our view that, despite regional differences, 
construction companies represent the fastest-
growing segment of BIM adopters and are 
leading the industry in innovative applications 
of the technology. Autodesk appreciates the 
opportunity to support meaningful research and 
analysis to learn from the industry and advance 
effective and efficient construction project 
management through BIM.
