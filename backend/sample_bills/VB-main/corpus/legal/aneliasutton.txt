journey
my name is ann smith
and i'm an award-winning advocate who
began doing legal research when my
daughter was railroaded in criminal
court with lies
it was a painful journey that i tucked
away for a long time and somehow i
survived it
which wasn't always easy for me it still
isn't
but along the way i figured out so many
things about how to make the legal
system work for my benefit
and now
i'm sharing it with you
in this video i'm going to talk about
the number one most requested thing
that i s that i get all the time i get
it all the time let's go man this is the
number one question i get asked and have
been asked for the last four years so it
is ready it is time i'm ready so let's
review it let's get it
new done for you document service this
is the page right but i'll go over
everything but i wanted to mainly focus
on the frequently asked questions
because there
bears a lot of fruit for to answer a lot
of the same questions that i've been
getting okay so let's let's jump into
this thing all right
Special Announcement
uh
let's just read
i will advocate for your rights and get
the justice that you deserve
uh
the special announcement is
about
i'm going to be working on my film
adaptation of my book
but even though
i'm not going to take the other types of
cases i will continue to offer child
custody sessions all year round that
has a very very special place in my
heart and i'll continue to help
you know mothers and fathers who are
in that battle
okay
so that's that okay let's jump into the
facts the faqs
are you a lawyer no i am not
i am a legal abuse survivor
and advocate i should say and single
mother who began legal research after my
daughter was railroaded in court and
committed into a state hospital with
lies
in my eight years of legal research i
learned that the law is perfect and it
does work
when you learn
how to work it for yourself
but the people who control the justice
system are corrupt and rotten to the
core
i believe in law and order and i believe
that when more people learn to make the
law work we all win as a society it's
literally how
lawless towns were won
Subject Matter Offered
okay
as you can see i didn't read that
verbatim but you get the gist
okay next
what subject matter is offered for this
document service okay i will say this
i started this document service just as
a test
to see if i could fit it into my
schedule all that kind of stuff and so i
limited
it to child support but now i'm opening
it up to all of these other
subject matter areas okay
so under
the
umbrella of family law
child support child custody divorce
okay
under the umbrella of contract law
dispute with lawyers which is my
favorite i love winning against lawyers
of course because you know they're
corrupt most of them not all but most
and uh civil law
and criminal law under various matters i
mean it
it it's too many to name so i just said
various okay
Success Rate
what is your success rate i get this a
lot
every case is different with many
variables too many variables i should
say from each individual man
woman courthouse county state agency and
the attorneys involved
all of this plays a major role in how
you have to respond to them to win right
so i handle the matters
in a very custom way that's custom to
you and your case so
not every case is going to be the same i
can't predict what you're going to be
sending to me so
there you have that uh and people don't
understand that like this is not cookie
cutter for me okay
so let's get into the
testimonial type of uh success
so
in disputes that i've i've served you
know against lawyers here we go the
fastest dispute resolution was a student
debt claim against a client
for fourteen thousand dollars which was
dismissed by the lawyer in seven days
right
disappeared didn't even want to talk to
me didn't want to talk to the client
okay he just dismissed the fourteen
thousand dollars
and that was that
Arrest Warrant
and it was super fast very impressive
arrest warrant
yeah this is my favorite one too because
it it speaks to judges
you know more so than an opposing
attorney so all i do is hold these
people accountable okay because i put in
the time i put in the research
and i also gave back to the community so
i i definitely put in a lot of blood
sweat and tears into this so i know what
i'm doing and i have the confidence to
make it happen
so yeah i wrote a couple notices to
judges i've gotten to the point where i
can write it in um
i don't know 10 minutes and one page
basically so the warrant
the arrest warrant was recalled the case
was closed and the file was updated on
the court website in five days now that
even amazed me like whoa
Foreclosure
all right so um
next foreclosure
i worked on a foreclosure case for a
friend
who became a client
and they uh the the court closed the
case and the auction was canceled and
that happened
in 10 days
i tell you
the stuff that i wish i wish i knew this
stuff a long time ago like i suffered
from foreclosure i suffer from all the
violations and abuse of the court so now
it just feels so good and so empowering
and believe me when you hire me as your
advocate
you'll learn so much just from the
paperwork that i deliver to you
that will make you
really
comfortable in your skin and confident
to present yourself to you know the
court so anyway moving right along okay
so the
i'm just passionate about this stuff
it's so it feels so good to impact so
many lives i'm telling you it's it's
it's a game changer anyway
uh for child support the testimonial for
the child support the fastest case was
closed in seven days now it can run all
the way up to three months because these
jokers don't like you to know what
you're talking about they want an easy
target right they want someone who just
gives in and gives up
well that doesn't happen with me
involved you know and i take care of all
the paperwork for you and if they
respond i respond right back and then it
just goes on until it closes basically i
stay with you until the case closed if
you hire me okay there's also courses
along the same lines of most of this
stuff
but
i offered the services because people
were getting confused and was sending
the documents to the wrong places i'm
talking about people in the course
and it was just
confusion but i get it because you know
you're stressed and you're you're scared
and all of that and that makes you act
impulsively and it's just a mess so i
that's pretty much why i decided to you
know what let me go ahead and open this
thing up to more
areas of law right so i'm here i'm doing
my part okay
so
Child Custody
on and on and on okay so the next one is
child custody
the fastest case that was closed under
you know in a child custody matter in
court was when the judge ordered the cps
agency
child protective services to return the
children in one hour again it just blows
me away um
some of these results i i'm impressed
with myself i'm impressed
i know that sounds ridiculous and
facetious but it's not i don't mean it
that way i'm just impressed with
how far
i've come along you know in this legal
case
matter situations i don't know what you
want to call it but yeah it's just it's
a it amazes me too
uh if it impresses you great if it
doesn't i'm i'm impressed i'm working
for me and for you right
so divorce the fastest resolution in the
divorce
matter that i handled
was in 15 days and i'm talking about
this was a oh nasty ugly contentious
divorce not talking hiding assets it was
a lot it was a mess it gave me a
headache
but
you know most of these cases do and most
of these cases are very heartbreaking
and so
yeah i just i was just a quick i just
think i have to call me back
yeah i get a lot of emails i get a lot
of phone calls and i just i can't it's
just it's a lot i'm overwhelmed so this
is the best way that i can be of service
to humanity
and keep a little bit of my sanity going
and
build the organization because my dream
is to one day
be able to offer all of this service for
free i want to build up a team and take
care of everybody and all of that but in
the meantime this is the best way that i
can handle it right now okay so let's
Divorce
see let's see where was i okay yeah the
fastest uh the nasty divorce case and i
don't get though i don't get a lot of
those maybe i'll i'll start getting more
now i don't know but
yeah it wasn't pretty it was an ugly
nasty case that had been going on for um
since 2018
uh two years or a year and a half
something like that over a year so
whatever and um
it doesn't matter how long a case has
been going on once i come on board it's
pretty much a seal and done deal right
because i don't play games with them i
hold them accountable that's really my
secret sauce i hold them accountable
to their laws how about that
okay so all right where was i i lost my
damn place okay i will do my best to get
favorable results every case is
different with different background
details
therefore i say again i cannot
guarantee these results
no one can
i have to emphasize that there's no
guarantee of any specific outcome
despite my best effort okay because i
don't want to be blamed for any
thing going wrong in your case or in
your situation at home because i am not
god
i'm not a miracle worker none of those i
just do
what i know to do best
by holding them the you know all of the
actors involved and all of the major
players i hold them accountable that's
it that's my whole secret sauce hold
them accountable to their own laws those
those laws applies to them not to you
and that's all i do
okay uh but i do it extremely well and
i'm very very proud of that because i've
come a long way this was not easy it was
eight long years of struggling through
this stuff okay
so
uh but the struggle was worth it because
you know
paying your dues is the way to
gain knowledge and experience and that's
and that's what i did
Whats Included
all right so so
let's keep going
what's included with my purchase okay so
each session includes document review
because i need to see what's going on i
need to see everything that they sent
you
and then i'll make recommendations
sometimes i need to step away and sleep
on it so i may meditate on some things
and that's how i get a nice little
download
you know just a mental uh download of
what i need to do
uh let's see let's see education i also
provide education to you that empowers
you to make informed decisions and this
is speaking specifically to people who
have an attorney or wish to
get an attorney
i can be
the
intermediary between you and your
attorney i don't discourage you from
getting an attorney if that's what you
want and if that's what your comfort
level is but then i can be the advocate
with you
while you're dealing with the attorney
and a lot of people like to do it that
way and i encourage it it's fine that's
fine but you don't need to if you have
me but if you want to
i'll
help you along the way okay you're grown
i don't tell grown folks what to do
that's what you want to do do what you
want to do that's comfortable for you
okay so legal research is also included
document preparation of course and that
total session
[Music]
the total session
is uh four hours
per session okay
so that's what you're getting for
the fee
Can I Purchase More Than Once
all right let's see let's see let's see
can i purchase more than once
absolutely in fact most cases require
more than one session of document
preparation
like i said sometimes the agency or the
court or whoever all the the players
involved the opposing counsel opposing
side will want to play games and go back
and forth and you may need to purchase a
second
um
session depending on how complicated it
is if it's like a simple response that i
need to do fine i'll just kind of like
just include it in in your first session
but if it requires me to do a deep dive
and all of that then yes you're going to
be needing to
you know hire me for a second session to
continue on okay that's just fair
uh okay
Can You Guarantee Ill Win
let's see let's say let's see can you
guarantee that i'll win oh i get that a
lot
no
i can only guarantee that your documents
will be prepared with the applicable
state and federal laws that hold the
moving party accountable to the law that
is my guarantee okay
Will We Have A Meeting
that's good keep it going will we have a
meeting
all communication and document exchange
will be handled
in the portal which includes the
document exchange and video calls as
needed
you know most likely i'll use zoom i've
been searching for different
different video chat services but
nothing has compared so far to zoom and
so
there you have it
we'll probably be zooming
Will You Contact People
will you contact people or make phone
calls or send emails on my behalf no
i will not
however i will provide you with the
appropriate responses that you can
communicate to the opposing party inside
the portal okay if you feel the need and
sometimes i'll encourage you listen
this requires a phone call and this is
what you can say to them and then we'll
talk about it and you get to your level
of con of comfort and confidence and
boom there you have it okay but no i'm
not contacting anybody on your behalf i
can't do that
okay
john get me in trouble no
My Fee
okay so
let's go why is your fee 2 000 per
session
okay well let's compare shall we the
cost for law school is a hundred
thousand dollars plus
four years of law school
then lawyers charge a retainer fee of
twenty five hundred dollars and that's
for starters that's just for starters
right
my fee is fair compensation for 10 000
plus hours of legal research making my
service fee
exceptionally fair
okay

custom intensive tedious and
time-consuming legal research to resolve
