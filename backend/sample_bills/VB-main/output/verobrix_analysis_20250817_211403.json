    "raw_text": "I was pulled over by Officer Martinez of the State Highway Patrol on Interstate 95 near mile marker 127 on January 15th, 2024 at approximately 3:30 PM. He claimed I was speeding 78 mph in a 65 mph zone and issued citation #SP-2024-00789. \n\nThe officer demanded to see my driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. When I asked about his authority to make this stop, he became agitated and threatened to arrest me for obstruction. He said I must appear in Municipal Court on February 20th, 2024 or face additional penalties including license suspension.\n\nThe citation contains several errors: it lists my vehicle as a 2018 Honda when I drive a 2019 Toyota, and the location is incorrectly stated as mile marker 125 instead of 127. The officer also failed to provide me with a copy of his calibration certificate for the radar device used.\n\nI was traveling for personal business, not commercial purposes, and believe this stop violated my constitutional right to travel. The fine amount is $275 plus court costs, with a deadline to pay or contest by February 5th, 2024. \n\nNotwithstanding my objections to the stop, I am subject to the court's jurisdiction according to the citation, which creates a contradiction in my legal standing. I need to understand my options for challenging this citation and protecting my rights.\n",
