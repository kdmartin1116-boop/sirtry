# Brandon Joe Williams: Key Teachings

This document summarizes the key teachings of Brandon Joe Williams, as they relate to the VeroBrix project.

## Core Concepts

*   **State National vs. U.S. Citizen:** Williams asserts that "U.S. citizen" is a corporate status that subjects individuals to federal jurisdiction. He advocates for individuals to reclaim their status as "State Nationals," which he claims places them under a different legal framework, governed by the common law.

*   **Legal Authorship & Precise Language:** A central theme is the importance of being the author of one's own legal documents. This involves using precise language, understanding the legal definitions of words, and avoiding the use of templates or forms provided by the state. By drafting their own documents, individuals can assert their own legal standing and avoid being bound by unfavorable terms.

*   **Contract Law as the Basis of a Just System:** Williams emphasizes the role of contracts in all legal interactions. He teaches that many legal obligations are based on contracts that individuals have unknowingly entered into. His "Contract Killer" course focuses on identifying and challenging these contracts.

*   **Micronation and Diplomatic Immunity:** Williams has created his own micronation, "The Amnesty Coalition," as a way to assert sovereignty and claim diplomatic immunity from the U.S. legal system.

## Relevance to VeroBrix

These teachings can be integrated into VeroBrix in the following ways:

*   **Filing Assistant:** The Filing Assistant can be designed to help users draft their own legal documents from scratch, rather than filling out forms. It can provide guidance on using precise language and avoiding common legal pitfalls.

*   **Semantic Tagger & Contradiction Engine:** These modules can be trained to identify and analyze the legal definitions of words, and to flag any contradictions or ambiguities in legal documents. They can also be used to analyze the structure of contracts and identify any unfavorable terms.

*   **Corpus System:** The Corpus System can be populated with materials that support the "State National" theory, such as historical legal documents and texts on common law.
