# Carl Miller: Key Teachings

This document summarizes the key teachings of Carl Miller, as they relate to the VeroBrix project.

## Core Concepts

*   **The Death of the Gods & The New Global Power Grab:** Miller's central thesis is that traditional power structures—governments, large corporations, and legacy media—are losing their monopoly on power. This power is being redistributed to a new set of actors, including hackers, social media influencers, and tech giants.

*   **Information Warfare:** The internet is not just a tool for communication; it is a new "theatre of war." Conflict is increasingly taking place in the digital realm, through the manipulation of information and the control of online narratives.

*   **Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT):** Miller is a proponent of using data science and social science to analyze online activity. This can be used to understand and counter a wide range of online threats, from election interference and radicalization to cybercrime and the spread of conspiracy theories.

*   **The Nature of Digital Conflict:** Information warfare is not just about spreading "disinformation." It also involves the creation of inauthentic identities, the manipulation of online discussions to create a false sense of consensus, and the use of AI and large language models to automate these processes.

## Relevance to VeroBrix

These teachings can be integrated into VeroBrix in the following ways:

*   **Situation Interpreter:** The Situation Interpreter can be designed to analyze the "information warfare" dimension of a legal situation. It can identify and flag attempts to manipulate online narratives, create false consensus, or use other information warfare tactics.

*   **Contradiction Engine:** The Contradiction Engine can be used to analyze legal documents for signs of manipulation or deception. It can also be used to identify and flag any contradictions between the law and the way it is being enforced.

*   **Remedy Synthesizer:** The Remedy Synthesizer can be programmed to suggest remedies that take into account the information warfare dimension of a legal situation. For example, it could suggest ways to counter online propaganda or to expose attempts to manipulate online discussions.

*   **Corpus System:** The Corpus System can be populated with materials that are relevant to the study of information warfare, such as Miller's book "The Death of the Gods" and other texts on digital power and online conflict.
