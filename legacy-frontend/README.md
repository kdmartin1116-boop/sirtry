# Legacy Frontend (Archived)

This directory contains the original, legacy JavaScript frontend application. It has been moved here for archival purposes and should **not** be actively developed or modified.

## Purpose:
This archive serves as a historical record of the previous frontend implementation. It may be useful for:
*   Referencing old UI/UX patterns.
*   Understanding how certain features were implemented previously.
*   Extracting specific assets or code snippets if absolutely necessary.

## Running the Legacy Frontend (if needed):
To run this legacy frontend, you would typically open `index.html` directly in a web browser. Ensure that all relative paths to `style.css` and any `script.js` files are correct within `index.html`.

## Future Considerations:
It is recommended to eventually remove this directory once its historical value is no longer required or if all relevant functionalities have been migrated to the new frontend. Establish a clear timeline or criteria for its eventual deletion.
